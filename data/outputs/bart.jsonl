In the decades since, the National Front, the BNP and the English Defence League have all tried to carve out a foothold in the area. In 2025, communities are fighting back against the hard right yet again. This week, police stopped the hard-right UK Independence Party (Ukip) from staging a “crusade on White chapel” in the borough of Tower Hamlets. The Metropolitan police said the ban was to prevent “serious disorder” It comes weeks after Tower Hamlet council passed a motion that said flags were “important emblems of patriotism and pride”, but condemned “outside far-right agitators … attempting to import division into our borough,” particularly on the Isle of Dogs."}

British Indians, who form about 3% of the population, are becoming increasingly important swing voters. At the last election 48% of British Indians voted for Labour, 21% for the Conservatives and only 4% for Reform. Now, however, Labour support stands at 35% with the Indian community, while the Conservatives have collapsed to 18%. Support for the Greens has also risen sharply, especially among younger voters, going from 8% at the election to 13% now. Research shows the shift is being driven in part by changing policy priorities. While Indian voters always put education at the top of their concerns, their second priority has changed from health to the economy now. Their third priority is crime, having been the environment five years ago. Equalities and human rights has dropped from fifth on the list of priorities to seventh."}

Instead, it was offered to her birthplace of Grantham, a town she left at the age of 18 and rarely visited again. The presence of Thatcher in her home town, on what would have been her 100th birthday, has drawn a small crowd outside the town’s Guildhall Arts Centre. Motorists toot horns; fans want selfies; passersby occasionally flick V-signs from across the street.

He believes Europe are in a better spot than they were at Medinah in 2012. McIlory says he would love to win an away Ryder Cup at Bethpage in New York. He also believes the event would benefit from even the occasional away success. The Masters in April will serve as the reference point for this and so many other golfing years, regardless of whether or not Luke Donald and co can topple Keegan Bradley’s USA. The tribal nature of a non-tribal sport triggers strange things, says Mc Ilroy. “It is not as if any of this is preitated. It might not involve me but it is inevitable, whether like in last time or something else,” he says."}

There are gay men commentating games, running clubs, breaking stories and winning premierships. And still, not a single footballer has come out publicly. Rankine isn’t the first footballer to make a monumental mistake and miss an opportunity to win a premiership.

The only lingering question is their quarterback. How JJ McCarthy slots into the Vikings’ offense is perhaps the most important variable in the championship race. The Eagles and Broncos should be the top defense in the NFC North. The Cowboys will eventually cave – as they always do. They’ll agree on a new deal on the eve of the new season, after lighting their training camp on fire and scoring Jones some headlines. If you asked the computer to simulate the perfect circumstances for a first-year starter, it would probably produce something like what the Vikings offer.

After Trump said in July that the historic building would not be touched, it was stealthily bulldozed to make way for a $300m ballroom. According to Trump, there was a teeny little change of plans “after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world” But the bulldozing went ahead without any such thing being submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government building. Trump has said the new 90,000 sq ft ballroom is going to be “paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine” Now the world's CEOs have a wonderful opportunity to prove just how friendly to Trump they are. Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google have already lined up to contribute to the project. Defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and Palantir – who seem to know a thing or two about reducing beloved buildings to rubble."}

The piece was originally titled: Did Women Ruin the Workplace? The headline was then changed to the more nuanced: Did Liberal Feminism Ruin the workplace? Helen Andrews, a critic of liberal feminism, explained that #MeToo was woke, college campuses are too woke, and “the law is currently lopsided in favor of punishing male vices and allowing feminized vices totally free rein” In response to a question about what constitutes “feminine vices”, Andrews explains that women like “gossiping” and have an “inability to deal with conflict directly” While the Times is busy pondering whether liberal feminism has ruined the workplace, women are being rolled back around the world. The leader of Mexico can’t do her own job without being harassed in public, and the Times wants us to consider whether the workplace has been too feminized."}

Like clockwork, this “peace” has already eroded with Israel violating the ceasefire through continued bombardments. In the first month, Israel has broken its own agreement at least 100 times: at least 200 murdered, the yellow line breached, food and fuel blocked, reconstruction prevented. The genocide never ends; it only modulates between active slaughter and slow strangulation. The fact that Israel's occupation and colonial expansion has continued unpunished by international authorities since 1967 is proof enough that they will never be held to the fire they started. They learned from American history between 30 million and 60 million buffalo roamed North America until the U.S. military deliberately slaughtered them to reduce their population. Not only is there no threat to Palestinian existence, but Hamas hides because there are fewer Palestinians to control than there were Native Americans to control. This is why Israel destroys not just people but the survival of itself: the water treatment plants, the agricultural fields, every university, every hospital."}

He had been in regular contact with the Guardian, describing daily survival in a place that for months has seemed doomed to fall to the RSF. In the months leading to El Fasher's fall, he said it felt as if he was being followed by drones. Many nights were spent inside a crude bomb shelter made from a metal container buried in the ground. He balanced his struggle for survival with trying to support those around him. He documented rights abuses while also organising burials for the dead. He believed it was this that attracted the ire of theRSF, when he shared information about Colombian mercenaries fighting on the peripheries of El FASHER. His friends and family have confirmed to the Guardian that DoudA has been killed. The RSF have been expelled. There are 60 martyrs and 100 injured. I went with my friend Ahmed to visit the wounded – there were countless women and children hit by stray bullets."}

But no one in this cowardly Labour government seems able", "summary": "In less than a month, the government will unveil a budget that will be huge in scope, and hugely painful. The public is likely to pick up a tab for £20-30bn in tax rises and spending cuts. This government is constitutionally incapable of such a thing, because that would involve picking sides and making enemies. The lack of argument is why all those earnest academics cannot discern an actual Starmerism, why the prime minister’s speeches are such utter blancmange. But it is about to prove highly damaging, perhaps even fatal. A few of us long ago warned that strapping oneself into a budgetary straitjacket was as unnecessary as any stunt by Ed Truss. That vacuum should be filled by the right in both parliament and the press, who will bang on about a lying government (which is fair) and a fiscal crisis. This weekend, they should be filling in Laura Kuenssberg about the expensive and arduous mission to fix a broken country. And preparing taxpayers for exactly how they’ll have to cough up."}

Zeynure says Chinese officials let him board the flight knowing he would be arrested when he arrived in Morocco and told he was going to be deported to China. She says: ‘I had to do something to do my husband – to tell the truth to the world. Everyone knows Uy Ghurs sent to China will die. They pushed me out.’ The second was as a Muslim UyGHur in Xinjiang, cut short by teachings of “communist songs” and being banned from going to the mosque or going to Ramadan. It was too beautiful, like a scene from a story from a beautiful, beautiful novel. The third was as an English teacher in Istanbul, helping to publish news and printed works."}

In August, an earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people. The impoverished country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions. The earthquake was also felt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of the northern Balkh province, where footage on social media showed slight damage to the historic Blue Mosque.

Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab has said the level of violence is comparable to the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide. Videos have emerged showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters”, according to the UN. The US, UN and others have also determined that the RSf has committed genocide and mass rape against ethnic Masalit and non-Arab communities in Darfur. In April, the RSF killed as many as 2,000 people when it seized the Zamzam camp for displaced people."}

In 1999, in the face of mainstream publishers’ seeming indifference to LGBTQ+ writing, she was instrumental in setting up and administering an authors’ collective, which became Paradise Press. Kathryn was a fine writer of short stories and poetry. Examples of her work appear in anthologies, but she was more concerned with promoting Elsa’s work and also encouraging and nurturing others with feedback and advice. Kathryn continued to run GAW and Gemma until forced by ill-health to hand over the work. She is survived by two cousins, William and Anne. Elsa died in 2019."}

He moved to a nursing home in central Stockholm, and I told myself everything would end well. Dad would finally get proper medication, physical therapy, new teeth, foot care and eye treatment for his declining vision. I imagined coming by with my sons, and we would finally be able to talk about everything: why he disappeared, what we might have done differently and why I still held on to the naive hope that he would apologise. After their first kiss, Dad asked Mom what her family name, Bergman, meant in Swedish. “Mountain man,” she said. He couldn’t believe it. He was a 21-year-old Tunisian store detective, using his impeccable eyesight to catch shoplifters in a mall in Lausanne, Switzerland."}

In England alone, the number of properties exposed to flooding is expected to rise by more than a quarter, from 6.3m to 8m. The story gets worse for those in high-risk areas for flash flooding, where the frequency could surge by up to 66% by 2050. The picture is so bleak that, startlingly, some towns may one day have to be abandoned altogether. This time, however, the warnings are not coming from environmental campaigners but from leaders in the insurance industry. They warn that large swathes of housing and commercial property in densely populated areas are among the most vulnerable to devastating flooding. In Bermondsey and Old Southwark in London, and Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, about 90% of homes could be at risk from river and coastal flooding by 2050 – that is the highest proportions anywhere in the country. The global economy has shown “unexpected resilience” to Donald Trump’s tariffs, but the full impact is yet to be felt, the IMF has warned."}

If you watched the interview on TV, you might have missed that particular bit because (weird!) it didn’t get aired. Trump-friendly editing of an interview conducted by a network now owned by the president's allies, with a head of news that he thinks is “great”, is part of a broader trend of US media outlets lying down and rolling over for Trump. Take Elon Musk, who helped propel Trump to his second term. First Musk bought Twitter – a very convenient way of controlling online discourse – and now he has launched his own AI-powered version of Wikipedia called Grokipedia."}

If Vance does run, he will have to spell out what he believes. The problem is, he doesn’t know. He once dismissed Trump as an ‘idiot’ he would “never” support. Now he himself does exactly that, all the time. Rubio is an altogether quieter, strangely passive figure and possibly the most ineffectual secretary ofState of recent times.

Rio officials said on Tuesday that at least 64 people, including four police officers, had been killed after a force of 2,500 launched a pre-dawn assault on Alemão and Penha, the vast patchwork of favelas of which Vila Cruzeiro is part. Most of the corpses were unclothed but a few wore ghillie suits, camouflage clothing used by snipers, hunters and nature photographers to conceal themselves in foliage.
