Musk's early life was shaped by a neo-Nazi grandfather and a system of education steeped in white supremacy, culminating in a period of intense social unrest and state repression.  Thiel, meanwhile, was educated in South Africa during a time when Hitler was still openly venerated and later attended a German-language school in Swakopmund, Namibia, a former German colony."}
