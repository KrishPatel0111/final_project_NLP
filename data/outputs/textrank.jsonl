Speaking on Real Time With Bill Maher, CK, who is co-headlining the festival with the British comedian Jimmy Carr on Monday night local time, said other comedians had been “really surprised” by the response from audiences in Riyadh so far. Comedians including Marc Maron, Atsuko Okatsuka and David Cross have been scathing of performers who have complained about cancel culture and censorship in the past for agreeing to take part in Riyadh, with Cross publishing a blistering statement on his website that called out CK by name. “People have been playing Saudi Arabia for years."}

Several comedians have questioned the ethics of performing comedy at a festival directly paid for by the Saudi Arabian government, which is notorious for human rights abuses and censorship, and its oppression of journalists, women and LGBTQ rights. Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Aziz Ansari, Hannibal Burress, Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, Tom Segura and Jeff Ross are among the lineup at Riyadh comedy festival, which finishes on 9 October."}

Eiry Thomas’s commanding Ffrier Lorens makes an impression and Llinor ap Gwynedd’s excellent turn as the Nyrs, mostly English-speaking but with a broad Welsh accent, is imbued with a new dramatic complexity within the bilingual conceit. Similarly, in the seclusion of her cell, the Ffrier and Romeo privately confer in Welsh, but respond to intrusive knocks from the outside world in English."}

Ellie Costello of Not Fine in School, which supports children and families struggling with school attendance, wants the government to ensure mandatory reporting of the use of isolation in mainstream schools, as is already the case with suspensions and exclusions. Earlier this year the high court upheld the use of isolation booths by schools in England, dashing the hopes of campaigners who claim they are stressful and stigmatising for pupils. The lead professor of #BeeWell, Neil Humphrey, said: “We know schools face huge pressures in managing behaviour, but our evidence suggests isolation is not the solution. The use of isolation, and in particular isolation booths, has become a growing source of concern among some parents, who complain about an overly punitive system that harms their child’s education and mental health. A DfE spokesperson said there should be high expectations around pupil behaviour and schools should expect parents to back them. Pupils on free school meals were more than one-and-a-half times more likely to be placed in isolation than their wealthier peers, researchers found from self-reported data provided by pupils."}

Maybe the diversity and inclusion stuff doesn’t totally make sense to Bettman in 2025 – other North American sports have decided that they don’t have the stomach to fight the culture wars under Trump either, and NFL commission Roger Goodell is also on the White House sports council. On Monday, Browne told the Guardian via email that “to see [Bettman, Gretzky, and Tkachuk] get behind an administration that is targeting marginalized communities, especially trans people in sports, is deeply disturbing and a huge step backwards in making hockey a more inclusive sport.” “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued. What’s so aggravating about repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from the NHL under the guise of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these views are all morally equivalent when they’re not."}

So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?", "summary": "Last week, Bettman was named alongside NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk and various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports council. “Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far – diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it."}

Although technological influences are only one part of rising political violence – along with mental health issues, political polarization and the widespread availability of firearms in the US – extremism researchers are increasingly studying the evolving ways that social media platforms and online spaces can radicalize and isolate users. In fact, some say that the current era of political violence differs from past incarnations specifically because of the way that social media and online communities have influenced and incentivized attackers. The result is that while online culture has enmeshed itself into extremism and political violence, previously secluded parts of the extremist internet culture have increasingly infected the everyday internet. In a 2023 paper for George Washington University’s Project on Extremism, Jacob Ware, a researcher described what he called a “third generation of online radicalization” that emerged in the late 2010s. Extremist mass killings at a supermarket in a predominantly Black area of Buffalo, New York, in 2022 and at a synagogue in Poway, California, in 2019 were both heavily versed in the language of fringe online forums. As others have noted, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter who attacked a Minneapolis Catholic school."}

Just before Christmas 2020, in the dying days of his first administration, Trump had already taken time off from his busy schedule promoting the big lie about having won the election in order to issue an executive order entitled “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture”. True, in one sense Trump’s case is unique: he already had a portfolio of buildings before assuming office – though most of his own buildings had never been particularly classical; instead, they are modern on the outside, while on the inside one finds a nouveau riche fever fantasy of Versailles – which has now also spawned an engoldened Oval Office, displaying what an astute critic, Kate Wagner, has called “regional car dealership rococo”."}
