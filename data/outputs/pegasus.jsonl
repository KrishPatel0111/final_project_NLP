In the decades since, the National Front, the BNP and the English Defence League have all tried to carve out a foothold in the area . This week, London’s police stopped the hard right UK Independence Party (Ukip) from staging a ‘crusade on Whitechapel’ in the borough of Tower Hamlets . While this weekend’s Ukip march has been stopped, counter-protesters still plan to gather in Whitechapel on Saturday . For Rosenberg, the repeated battle against the far right reflects two different visions of working-class life – one diverse, the other homogenous . But for months, tensions have been simmering in Tower Hamlets, as rightwingers have made its diversity the centre of a culture war . Last week, Safia Jama, the 47-year-old CEO of the charity Women’s Inclusive Team, was chairing a Stand Up to Racism meeting when it was disrupted by rightwing protesters ."}

It was the first stage of a project Trump has advertised as the addition to the White House of a 90,000 sq ft ballroom . The ballroom will be funded via private donations, setting up yet another race to curry favour with the president . For many Americans, the demolition photos were soul-shuddering in a way that has no direct equivalence in the UK . But the building at No 10, and the living quarters in particular, have never been as iconic or emotionally charged as their US counterparts .

Because he wants to", "summary": "The 123-year-old East Wing of the White House, the home of offices for every first lady for almost half a century, is now a pile of rubble . After Trump said in July that the historic building would not be touched, it was stealthily bulldozed to make way for a $300m ballroom . Trump has said the new 90,000 sq ft ballroom is going to be paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine . A list of donors including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google have already lined up to contribute to the project . The US constitution’s 22nd amendment makes it very clear that a president cannot have more than two terms . In March, he told NBC News he was ‘not joking’ about the idea and that there were methods for doing so . And this week, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Steven Bannon, told the Economist that the president will ‘get a third term’"}

In 2008, Israel violated a months-long truce with Hamas by launching an operation that killed six Hamas members, then used the predictable rocket response to justify Operation Cast Lead . Nearly half of all Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since records began in 2005 were killed in just the past two years, 224 children since January 2023 out of 468 total . This year, Israel approved its largest settlement expansion since Oslo, 22 new illegal settlements, some deep within Palestine . The method never changes: violate the ceasefire, wait for retaliation, claim victimhood, launch the offensive you’d already planned . Just look at the West Bank, where Palestinians laid down their weapons after the sham that is the Oslo Accords. What did demilitarization bring them? More settlements, more checkpoints, more children shot by snipers, more olive groves burned, more homes demolished ."}

All those clenched jaws and gritted teeth surely helped at last summer’s election, when Labour secured a majority a mile wide and an inch deep .

They should have spent months – years – arguing that the public realm needs investment, and laying out the stats that show the average British worker is taxed less than counterparts in most of western Europe .
