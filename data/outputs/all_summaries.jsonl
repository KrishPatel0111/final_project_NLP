Several comedians have questioned the ethics of performing comedy at a festival directly paid for by the Saudi Arabian government, which is notorious for human rights abuses and censorship, and its oppression of journalists, women and LGBTQ rights. Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Aziz Ansari, Hannibal Burress, Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, Tom Segura and Jeff Ross are among the lineup at Riyadh comedy festival, which finishes on 9 October."}

Similarly, in the seclusion of her cell, the Ffrier and Romeo privately confer in Welsh, but respond to intrusive knocks from the outside world in English."}

Earlier this year the high court upheld the use of isolation booths by schools in England, dashing the hopes of campaigners who claim they are stressful and stigmatising for pupils. The lead professor of #BeeWell, Neil Humphrey, said: “We know schools face huge pressures in managing behaviour, but our evidence suggests isolation is not the solution. The use of isolation, and in particular isolation booths, has become a growing source of concern among some parents, who complain about an overly punitive system that harms their child’s education and mental health. A DfE spokesperson said there should be high expectations around pupil behaviour and schools should expect parents to back them. Pupils on free school meals were more than one-and-a-half times more likely to be placed in isolation than their wealthier peers, researchers found from self-reported data provided by pupils."}

What’s so aggravating about repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from the NHL under the guise of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these views are all morally equivalent when they’re not."}

So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?", "summary": "Last week, Bettman was named alongside NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk and various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports council. “Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far – diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it."}

The result is that while online culture has enmeshed itself into extremism and political violence, previously secluded parts of the extremist internet culture have increasingly infected the everyday internet. In a 2023 paper for George Washington University’s Project on Extremism, Jacob Ware, a researcher described what he called a “third generation of online radicalization” that emerged in the late 2010s. Extremist mass killings at a supermarket in a predominantly Black area of Buffalo, New York, in 2022 and at a synagogue in Poway, California, in 2019 were both heavily versed in the language of fringe online forums. As others have noted, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter who attacked a Minneapolis Catholic school."}

Just before Christmas 2020, in the dying days of his first administration, Trump had already taken time off from his busy schedule promoting the big lie about having won the election in order to issue an executive order entitled “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture”. True, in one sense Trump’s case is unique: he already had a portfolio of buildings before assuming office – though most of his own buildings had never been particularly classical; instead, they are modern on the outside, while on the inside one finds a nouveau riche fever fantasy of Versailles – which has now also spawned an engoldened Oval Office, displaying what an astute critic, Kate Wagner, has called “regional car dealership rococo”."}

British Indians, who form about 3% of the population, are becoming increasingly important swing voters. At the last election 48% of British Indians voted for Labour, 21% for the Conservatives and only 4% for Reform. Now, however, Labour support stands at 35% with the Indian community, while the Conservatives have collapsed to 18%. Support for the Greens has also risen sharply, especially among younger voters, going from 8% at the election to 13% now. Research shows the shift is being driven in part by changing policy priorities. While Indian voters always put education at the top of their concerns, their second priority has changed from health to the economy now. Their third priority is crime, having been the environment five years ago. Equalities and human rights has dropped from fifth on the list of priorities to seventh."}

The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful.

There are gay men commentating games, running clubs, breaking stories and winning premierships. And still, not a single footballer has come out publicly. Rankine isn’t the first footballer to make a monumental mistake and miss an opportunity to win a premiership.

The Eagles and Broncos should be the top defense in the NFC North. The Cowboys will eventually cave – as they always do. They’ll agree on a new deal on the eve of the new season, after lighting their training camp on fire and scoring Jones some headlines. If you asked the computer to simulate the perfect circumstances for a first-year starter, it would probably produce something like what the Vikings offer.

The piece was originally titled: Did Women Ruin the Workplace? The headline was then changed to the more nuanced: Did Liberal Feminism Ruin the workplace? Helen Andrews, a critic of liberal feminism, explained that #MeToo was woke, college campuses are too woke, and “the law is currently lopsided in favor of punishing male vices and allowing feminized vices totally free rein” In response to a question about what constitutes “feminine vices”, Andrews explains that women like “gossiping” and have an “inability to deal with conflict directly” While the Times is busy pondering whether liberal feminism has ruined the workplace, women are being rolled back around the world. The leader of Mexico can’t do her own job without being harassed in public, and the Times wants us to consider whether the workplace has been too feminized."}

In the first month, Israel has broken its own agreement at least 100 times: at least 200 murdered, the yellow line breached, food and fuel blocked, reconstruction prevented. The genocide never ends; it only modulates between active slaughter and slow strangulation. The fact that Israel's occupation and colonial expansion has continued unpunished by international authorities since 1967 is proof enough that they will never be held to the fire they started. They learned from American history between 30 million and 60 million buffalo roamed North America until the U.S. military deliberately slaughtered them to reduce their population. Not only is there no threat to Palestinian existence, but Hamas hides because there are fewer Palestinians to control than there were Native Americans to control. This is why Israel destroys not just people but the survival of itself: the water treatment plants, the agricultural fields, every university, every hospital."}

They warn that large swathes of housing and commercial property in densely populated areas are among the most vulnerable to devastating flooding. In Bermondsey and Old Southwark in London, and Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, about 90% of homes could be at risk from river and coastal flooding by 2050 – that is the highest proportions anywhere in the country.

It is now the official Reform. Parliament would be sovereign. Apart from the bits that wouldn't be sovereign . At least half of ministers would be Nige's personal appointments. That would probably be the same five departments Labour had already promised to discontinue . The idiocy levels were rising still higher. Sometimes you have to wonder whether he thinks before he speaks . Not that he was in the mood to apologise. Danny is very much old school. Everything is always someone else’s fault. Reform would discontinue the leases of five Whitehall departments."}

Her experience of teaching groups of young children in Hackney, coupled with her understanding of linguistic development, led her to realise that bilingual young children’s language competence depended on them maintaining their home language as an essential precondition to learning English . When she retired, she began to work as a volunteer in Holloway and Pentonville prisons, helping organise family days, when children could play with their imprisoned parents .

Founded in 2003 by Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström, Skype was headquartered in Luxembourg and quickly gained popularity, reaching 100 million registered users by 2006 and generating significant revenue.  Acquired by eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion, Skype was later purchased by Microsoft in 2011. Despite its success, Skype ultimately failed to compete with the rise of platforms like Zoom during the pandemic, leading to its eventual demise.  Skype's impact, however, remains significant, as it transformed the landscape of communication, making international calls affordable and accessible to a wider audience."}

Instead of engaging in reasoned argument, the government resorts to anonymous briefings and personal attacks, creating a toxic atmosphere.

Areas like Little Ireland, where Engels' companion Mary Burns resided, were marked by extreme residential segregation. Contrary to the study's claim that more than 10% of the population in Manchester's 'slums' were from the better-off classes, places like Moss Side and Hulme in the 1970s and 80s were predominantly working class, with many impoverished residents. Suggesting class was not crucial seems to overlook the importance of class distinctions in Manchester during that time."}

Despite the author's hopes for improved care, their father continued to call multiple times a day, expressing paranoia and a desire to leave the home. The father's most crushing loss was the divorce, and he cursed the family, predicting they would become homeless drug addicts.
