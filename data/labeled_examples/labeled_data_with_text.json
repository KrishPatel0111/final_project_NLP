    "article_text": "Donald Trump wants to shut down the US Department of Education, saying at recent rallies that it should be disbanded to “move everything back to the states where it belongs”. The idea of dismantling the education department has become increasingly mainstream, though it’s nearly as old as the department itself, which was created by Congress as a cabinet-level agency in 1979. Trump made similar promises on the 2016 campaign trail to either cut or hobble the department. Eliminating it would require Congress to act, which could be an impossible feat, though several of Trump and his allies’ policy goals on education could be accomplished through presidential actions. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing manifesto for a potential incoming Trump administration, lays out how dismantling the federal education department would work, leaving behind, if anything, a husk focused solely as a “statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states”, writes Lindsey Burke, the author of the education chapter and leader of Heritage’s education policy center. The department’s elimination is one of many goals contained in the extensive conservative playbook that will inform a second Trump term. Project 2025 calls for privatizing education and driving out any programs related to LGBTQ+ youth or diversity. “This playbook actually goes into detail that we’ve never seen before,” said Weadé James, senior director for K-12 policy at the Center for American Progress. It would have profound implications on civil rights, school funding and students’ progress – not to mention on the fate of public schools, she said. “The striking part about all of this, too, is the Department of Education is actually the smallest of any cabinet-level agency. There are only a little over 4,000 employees within the department,” James said. “So we need to be talking about investing in the department, expanding the capacity of the department to do the work that it is designed to do.” Burke, the Heritage author , declined a request for an interview. In a statement, the Heritage Foundation said that while it seeks to offer recommendations to the “next conservative president”, it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign”. And while Trump’s campaign has tried to distance the candidate from Project 2025, saying he has his own agenda to carry out, the former president and the project are aligned on much of their education plans. During a speech to a “faith and freedom” conference this week, Trump railed against education rankings and spending, saying the US performs poorly despite money spent on students. Some states could do better without federal intervention, he said. “We’ll cut our budget in half and not everybody’s going to be great,” he said. “I mean, [California governor] Gavin Newsom will not do a good job with education, so I don’t expect that out of him. And I don’t expect it out of certain other people … But many of the states, I would say 40 of the 50 states will do much better. And I’ll bet you 30 of the states will be phenomenal.” Trump tells voters on his campaign site a few ways he would manage education: Cut federal funding for schools that are “pushing critical race theory or gender ideology on our children” and open civil rights investigations into them for race-based discrimination. End access for trans youth to sports. Create a body that will certify teachers who “embrace patriotic values”. Reward districts that get rid of teacher tenure. Adopt a parents’ bill of rights. Implement direct elections of school principals by parents. School funding fundamentally changed Education is primarily funded and overseen by state and local authorities in the US, but the federal government funds some elements of education and sets certain policies, which are then implemented locally. As it stands now, schools receive federal grants targeted toward specific purposes, like aiding low-income students or students with disabilities. States implement these programs, often hiring people to ensure they comply with federal requirements. Project 2025 posits various ways to put states in control of programs the federal government now funds and manages. Instead of directing how funds should be used, it generally says states should be given money with no strings attached to spend on “any lawful education purpose under state law”. These “block grants” often receive pushback. And when states receive set amounts rather than funds based on specific needs, they can often fall short. The project proposes phasing out one major program, Title I, over a 10-year period. The $18bn funding source supports low-income students. Instead, the project says states “should assume decision-making control over how to provide a quality education to children from low-income families”. “Phasing that out is going to be very detrimental to that population of students who are already vulnerable for many reasons,” James said. The Heritage Foundation also wants to eliminate Head Start, a program that funds early childhood education for low-income families, because it is “fraught with scandal and abuse”, according to a chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services. The Center for American Progress says in a new report that eliminating Head Start would reduce access and increase costs for childcare, hurting economic stability. Beyond these major funding changes, the project – and Trump – both want to see expansions of school choice, like voucher programs that allow students to use money that would otherwise fund their seats at public schools to attend a private ones. Trump has said that he supports universal school choice, or the ability of any student to use taxpayer funds to attend whatever school they want. Trump also has a video on his campaign site dedicated to how he would help home-schooling families. “What about those students who are going to remain in those public schools?” James said. “We need to change our rhetoric to really focus on investment in public schools, as opposed to vouchers that take away from public schools.” The project cites Arizona’s expansion of vouchers to all students as a model, though the program there has been the subject of much scrutiny, including recently over costs. LGBTQ+ and diversity issues attacked Anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-diversity policies are sprinkled throughout the education recommendations in Project 2025 and in Trump’s platform. The project also supports passing a parents’ bill of rights to give parents more access to classroom materials. The project proposes ridding education programs of any “gender ideology and critical race theory”, like a “non-binary” category in data collection or the ability of trans youth to participate in sports aligned with their gender. It also calls for parental approval for the use of names or pronouns other than those on birth certificates. And it wants to gut protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Project 2025 suggests the federal government put anti-LGBTQ+ policies in place in the schools it oversees as a way to set an example to state and local leaders. As examples of what the project considers “critical race theory” that should be abolished, it mentions “mandatory affinity groups”, training programs for teachers that require them to “confess their privilege” or assignments in which “students must defend the false idea that America is systemically racist”. These activities are “actively disrupting the values that hold communities together such as equality under the law and colorblindness”. The project also wants what remains of the Department of Education to gather data and report on programs or grants that spread “DEI/CRT/gender ideology”, how “family structure” affects student achievement, how pandemic aid funds were spent and how much money goes directly into the classroom from federal grant programs. Trump has made it a regular part of his rallies to harp on diversity and LGBTQ+ issues in schools, too. At the faith conference, he vowed to sign an executive order on day one that would cut federal funding for “any school pushing critical race theory, transgender, insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on to the lives of our children”.",

    "article_text": "University leaders have cautioned students planning to take part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations to coincide with the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, warning them that “expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence”. Up to 10 events – variously described as vigils, rallies and debates – are thought to have been planned on or near campuses on Tuesday, including an “inter-university” march in London, involving students and staff from several London institutions. It will be the second anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead, many more injured or kidnapped and sparked the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 65,000 people. Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-chancellors and acts as the voice of the sector, wrote to members last week after the attack on Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, warning that the anniversary was a “potential flashpoint” and urging members to “review security arrangements”. Vivienne Stern, the UUK’s chief executive, said: “While universities must be places where contentious views can be expressed, and while universities have a legal duty to uphold free speech, we urge students and staff participating in protests to remember that 7 October is the anniversary of an atrocious attack on innocent people, and that expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence.” Details of the London march are posted on Instagram under the banner headline: “Inter-university march. Two years of genocide and our institutions remain complicit.” It calls for a walkout of classes at 2pm, with the route taking in King’s College London (KCL), the London School of Economics, University College London and finishing at SOAS. Other 7 October events have been advertised at the University of Sheffield, where the Revolutionary Communist party is staging a “rally for Palestine”, and Strathclyde University, where the Palestine Solidarity Society is staging a “Protest 4 Palestine”, while KCL Students for Justice for Palestine has an evening of debate and discussion called “Why it didn’t start on October 7th”. Stern said there has been a “deeply concerning” rise in antisemitic incidents in the last two years and the “UUK has worked closely with university leaders to tackle this”. She urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents. “We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,” she added. Louis Danker, the president of the Union of Jewish Students, said: “We respect the right to protest and the importance of free speech within the law. There are 365 days in the year and on one of them – 7 October – Jewish students seek the space to mourn their loved ones murdered in southern Israel. “Moreover, marking ‘two years of resistance’ on 7 October echoes the explicit justification and glorification of the Hamas terrorist attacks on campus witnessed over the last two years. “No Jewish student should have to stand by as others glorify a day that marks such loss for our community. We have written to vice-chancellors and university leaders to remind them of their obligation to stand against the glorification of terror.” On Monday evening Keir Starmer urged students not to take part in what he called “un-British” protests. Writing in the Times, the prime minister said: “Let me just spell that out for a moment: people on our streets calling for the murder of Jewish people they have never even met, for something they are not responsible for. A total loss of empathy and humanity not in some faraway land but right here in the heart of our country. “And today, on the anniversary of the atrocities of 7 October, students are once again planning protests. This is not who we are as a country. It’s un-British to have so little respect for others. And that’s before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.” On Saturday police arrested almost 500 people in London at what organisers hoped would be the biggest demonstration so far against a ban on the proscribed organisation Palestine Action. The demonstration went ahead despite Starmer calling on protesters to call it off to “respect the grief of British Jews”, while Jewish leaders described the action as “phenomenally tone deaf” after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “The horrific tragedy in Manchester makes clear now more than ever that there is absolutely no place for antisemitic abuse or harassment, hate speech or violence in our society. “I would urge those planning to protest to show decency and humanity when deciding whether to do so, given the immense pain many people in the Jewish community will be feeling on 7 October. “I remain steadfast in my support for university vice-chancellors in tackling the scourge of antisemitic abuse and harassment on campuses, and I have written to them in support of their efforts.”",

    "article_text": "For months, the threatening phone calls kept coming. First, allegedly from an ex-police officer and a retired army general, and then from the police themselves. Finally, Mohammad Khurshid Shaikh claims, he was summoned to the police station and told clearly: keep quiet or there will be real trouble for you. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. “The culture and ecosystem of Dharavi is like nowhere else in the world,” says Shaikh. “But they want to destroy our community and stop us speaking out.” The dank gullies of Dharavi sit in stark contrast to the soaring skyscrapers and Bollywood penthouses that loom over the settlement. Homes are built haphazardly and often without proper sanitation, unregulated industries emit toxic smoke and the air is filled with the suffocating smell of open sewers. To some, the promise of Dharavi transformed into a glistening neighbourhood of luxury high-rises, neat parks, shiny shopping centres and homes with two toilets is an aspirational dream come true. “We don’t have proper healthcare, roads or drainage and there’s nowhere for children to play,” says A Selvin Nadar, 56, a chai seller who migrated from Tamil Nadu in 1982. “The only way is to tear it all down and build us new homes.” But others, such as Shaikh, are resisting. None deny that Dharavi, long neglected as an illegal encroachment, is in stark need of investment and development. Yet they fear that this plan – absent of public consultation – is one that will turn a piece of prime Mumbai real estate into a playground for the rich, forcing out the lower-caste, migrant communities who have been there since the late 1800s. It was these shunned, displaced people who built up the empty marshland into a widely studied marvel of self-reliance and economic productivity, whose output is valued at between $1bn and $2bn a year, making it one of the world’s largest informal economies. Of the roughly 1 million residents living in the dense 220-hectare (2.2 sq km) area, fewer than half will be eligible for new homes in the development, which is projected to take seven years to complete. Others will be moved to wastelands and salt plains on the far outskirts of the city, threatening to fragment a generations-old community. Some will not get homes at all. Those allowed to remain in Dharavi will be given apartments in tower blocks, a significant rupture from the organic, communal way of living and working that has sustained Dharavi for so long. Industries from tailoring to pottery and recycling are likely to shrink in number and be moved to a designated “commercial zone” far from people’s residences. For those such as Shaikh, a leather artisan and third generation of his family to live in Dharavi, the plan presents an existential threat. His rickety, three-storey workshop makes leather coats – sharp blazers, suede trenches, studded bomber jackets – sold in high-end shops in south Mumbai and abroad. His family lives in the rooms below and his workers and tailors – migrants from north India – also sleep there, enabling him to afford their labour. Outside Dharavi’s enclave, Mumbai rents are often 10 times as high for a single room. Harassment and intimidation In the government offices nearby, an illustrated mock-up of the Dharavi project depicts a very different vision for the future. Slickly dressed residents mill about on bicycles and e-vehicles, buying western-style baguettes and croissants and having coffee on a terrace outside Dharavi Cafe and Ice-Cream. It is a world away from the 20-rupee (18p) idli sambar breakfast and 5-rupee chai (3p) that sustains Dharavi’s community. “This is not development for us,” says Shaikh. “It’s a massive real estate deal that will make it unaffordable for us to survive.” There is also distrust of the Adani Group. Run by Gautam Adani – one of India’s most powerful tycoons and a close ally of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi – the conglomerate has faced accusations of crony capitalism and financial impropriety, which it denies. While the state government calls it a joint project, Adani Group paid $950m for its 80% stake. A case alleging that the project was unfairly awarded to Adani is being considered in India’s supreme court. Since they began to vocally oppose the development, Shaikh and other residents claim they have been subjected to a long-running campaign of harassment and intimidation – including phone calls, direct threats and suggestions that speaking against the project was to speak against the country – by figures they allege work for Adani Group. Among those accused of issuing the threats is Vilas Gangawane, a retired police officer. Gangawane confirmed to the Guardian he was working as an intelligence officer for Adani Group in Dharavi but denied any threats or coercion and said those who made the allegations had “malicious intentions”. A spokesperson for Navbharat Mega Developers Private Limited, the Adani-government entity handling Dharavi, said all accusations of intimidation and harassment were “unfounded” and that their survey had been done “with complete fairness and transparency”. The project, they added, had received “enthusiastic support from the local community” and was under close supervision of the state government. “It is unfortunate that a small section with vested interests is spreading a false narrative to discredit the project and its officials,” the spokesperson said. Among residents, many illiterate and from the lowest strata of society, fears of displacement remain rife. Only those who can prove they were ground-floor residents before 1 January 2000 are eligible for a house in the new development. One of the documents required to prove residency is an electricity bill – but Dharavi only got full electricity coverage in 2008. Though homes and workshops are scheduled for demolition within the next two months, the final masterplan for the development has still not been made public. Jitender Jathwa, 48, is among 5,000 clay artisans working in Dharavi, where he is part of an efficient ecosystem built over four generations; the potters live next to their workshops and the pottery market. “They are heartless to the survival of our craft,” says Jathwa. “How will I work if we are moved far away from our workshops? And even if I get a house in a shiny tower, how could I afford to maintain a place like that? Eventually I would be forced out.” Mahendra Kalyankar, the government chief executive of the Dharavi project, denied that the development would ostracise and fragment the community and said he had not heard of residents facing pressure. “A dignified house is a necessity for everyone,” says Kalyankar. “Everything has been minutely planned and taken into consideration. Dharavi can become a central business district if developed properly and it will be a paradise on earth for residents. Once we start the work, there will be no issues of trust.” Kalyankar said the terms of rehabilitation for Dharavi residents were “much more generous” than other slum projects in Mumbai. Those who can prove they were residents between 2000 and 2011 will be moved to other designated sites and given new homes for 250,000 rupees (£2,200), still a significant sum for many. Yet these sites are miles away from Dharavi and include Deonar, which has been a waste-dumping ground for decades. Officials said the site was being decommissioned but, when the Guardian visited, dozens of rubbish trucks were still dumping large quantities of Mumbai’s waste. The air was also heavily polluted, the result of methane fires at the dump and emissions from a nearby energy plant that burns rubbish. Residents around Deonar said they were experiencing chronic health problems caused by the toxic air, a situation they described as devastating for their children. “Why would they bring people from Dharavi here, it is not safe even to breathe,” says Jamal Ud Din, 39, a shoemaker whose house abuts the waste ground. “They will be moving them into hell.” • This article was amended on 6 November 2025. An earlier version said the economy of Dharavi is valued between $1m and $2m a year; this should have said between $1bn and $2bn.",

    "article_text": "When I was leaving London for Melbourne, my eldest sister-in-law told her kids not to forget the “tradition” – to throw a bowl of water behind me as I stepped out the door. Just a small splash on the ground, a gesture older than borders. “La har azaab po aman se,” she whispered in Pashto under her breath – may all hardship stay away from you. The little ones giggled and waved their goodbyes as they spilled the water, somewhere between shy and amused. My mother used to do this too, back in Afghanistan. Every time I left for a journey, especially international ones, she’d quietly follow me to the gate with a bowl of water, whispering prayers I couldn’t always hear. But this moment, between two western cities, with children growing up in a world so far from where that habit began, felt different. It was softer. Bittersweet. Like watching an old song being hummed in a new language. I grew up between Kabul and Karachi; two cities that always felt like they were on the edge of something. One broken by war, the other always just holding itself together amid all sorts of hardships of a city outgrowing itself but starved of resources and infrastructure. In both, I learned that people survive not just through faith but through the small things they do when no one’s watching; the quiet rituals and little beliefs that live in everyday life. They’re not loud, not official. But they’re full of love and hope. I saw it all around me. In the way my grandmother would suggest a black cloth by the door after someone recovered from illness or we bought something “precious” – to keep the evil eye away. In the way my aunt would burn esfand herb above her children in a pot when they came home from a wedding or party looking too beautiful and getting too much attention. In the way my other sister-in-law would put a tiny black dot behind her baby’s ear when he smiled too much – just to hide some of that beauty from the world. “People are not very nice and too much goodness invites jealousy and negativity,” she’d say. “It’s better to be a little hidden.” Drawing on my own encounters, I’ve come to see how these seemingly small gestures – the fragrant smoke of esfand to lift heaviness, the rhythmic pull of qawwali, the quiet assurance of a taweez tied around a wrist – hold more than superstition. They carry virtues: grounding, comfort and a deep sense of protection. None of these things were in any book of religion. No one ever sat down and taught them. They were just picked up, like pebbles from the ground, passed from women to girls, from grandmothers to mothers to daughters – and sometimes to sons who were paying attention. Even the most religious people I know – people who prayed five times a day, who fasted every Ramadan, who could quote the Qur’an by heart – still do these little things. They didn’t see them as separate or wrong. Just part of faith and tradition woven together into everyday life, to feel safe and at peace. When I moved to Melbourne, I carried some of those things with me. Not in boxes but in habits. I still whisper Ayatul Kursi before a flight, even if I’m late and running through the airport. I still avoid sweeping the house at night, not because I’m scared but because I remember my mother saying, “You’ll sweep away your blessings”. Sometimes I think these little rituals stayed with me more than the big teachings. Not because they were more important but because they were more personal. More human. They helped us make sense of a world that often didn’t make sense. Especially back home where things could change overnight, where life was unpredictable, where people had lost so much. And they remind me that spirituality itself isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice, woven into daily life. It takes on local colours while pointing to something universal. I’ve seen echoes of it elsewhere in the chanting circles of Indigenous Australians, where voices rise together in rhythm and prayer; in the protective rituals of other communities, each finding its own way of asking for peace. Across cultures, people reach for these small, invisible shields. I still remember the trees outside a mosque in the bazaar of Kabul. People used to tie little strips of cloth to its branches; one for each prayer they made. Because these rituals are more than just old habits. They are threads that connect us to our past, whispers of love carried across generations and subtle ways of finding peace in a world that so often feels chaotic. Maybe one day, they will fade. Maybe the children who threw water behind me in London won’t pass the tradition on to their own kids. But as long as we live, humans will search for these quiet, innocent acts of hope and protection gestures that don’t always make sense on paper but make all the difference in the heart. • Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and Australia",

    "article_text": "Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s partial demolition of the East Wing of the White House for his proposed $250m gilded ballroom. Stephen Colbert “At this point, we’re nine months into this, you’d think it would be impossible for us to be shocked by Donald Trump,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “But give the man credit – every so often, he takes the time to attach the electrodes to our nipples. And then it feels like the first time.” Case in point: on Monday, as part of his White House renovation project to construct a gilded ballroom, Trump sent out a backhoe to rip off a part of the East Wing. “That is it, we are not giving him the security deposit back,” Colbert quipped. “That is so deeply unsettling,” he continued. “It’s like being a kid and seeing your teacher at the grocery store … for sale … in the meat department. “We’re just nine months into Trump’s term, and he’s already going ‘Hulk smash’ on the White House. Last time, it took at least four years to bring a demo crew to the Capitol,” he added, referring to January 6. The demolition comes after Trump promised that the $250m, 90,000-sq-ft ballroom renovation would not touch the existing White House. “So that was a lie,” said Colbert. “At this point, should we even believe that this is going to end up being a ballroom? It could just as easily end up being a combination Pizza Hut-Taco Bell!” The treasury department has even instructed its employees not to share any photos of the White House “construction”. “Not generally something you instruct when you’re proud of what’s going on,” Colbert noted. “Hey guys, remember, no photos at my wedding … and it’s not because I’m marrying a body pillow of Mariah Carey.’” The Daily Show “The government shutdown is now in its third week,” said Michael Kosta on the Daily Show. “Countless federal employees aren’t being paid. Food stamps will run out soon. And there’s no end in sight. But not to worry – President Trump is working day and night … to build a ballroom! “It’s exactly what you voted for, coalminers in Pennsylvania: 90,000 gilded sq ft for Trump to do the jerk-off dance in,” he joked. “But if you’re worried such a renovation might damage the people’s house, let Donald Trump put your fears to rest.” Trump claimed that the project would “not interfere with the current building” because it would be “near it but not touching it” and “paying total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of, it’s my favorite” “Yeah, it’s my favorite. I never want to leave … and I’m never going to,” Kosta mocked. “I believe it’s his favorite building, though. He loves the history, the decor, the immunity from criminal convictions it provides. But great! The White House itself is going to be fine.” Until a backhoe tore down some of the East Wing facade. “Well, it looks like they touched it,” Kosta joked. “I mean, holy shit, who’s his general contractor? Bin Laden and Sons?” “Apparently ‘not touching’ the White House turned into ‘demolishing’ the White House,” he added. “And for what? Does he really need a ballroom attached to his home? I mean, I guess it would be good to have one room where Barron did not have to crouch, but still.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also responded to the East Wing demolition. “You guys, I don’t think he’s planning on leaving in three years,” he said. “If I had three years left on a lease, I wouldn’t even put up a shelf.” In other news, during a White House press conference on Monday, Trump claimed that a cameraman hit a mirror with a piece of equipment. “Luckily, no one in his administration casts a reflection,” Meyers joked next to a photo of ghoulish adviser Stephen Miller. After Trump praised the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, during a press conference on Monday, Albanese said that he would use clips of those compliments in 2028 campaign ads. “So will I, said his opponent,” Meyers quipped. And more than a dozen airports across the country have refused to play a partisan video of the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, at TSA checkpoints. “It just really riles up the dogs,” Meyers said, referring to Noem’s admission in her own memoir that she shot her own puppy for its behavior.",

    "article_text": "As if truffling thuggishly in pursuit of the Nobel peace prize wasn’t enough, the spectacle of bulldozers ripping into the White House is yet more evidence of Donald Trump’s unstinting quest for epic self-aggrandisement. Having decreed the East Wing not fit for purpose – namely, his purposes of swank and show – he plans to replace it with a faux classical bulletproof ballroom, capable of seating up to 650 partygoers. Renderings show a vast, glacially white aircraft hangar of a structure embellished with an ornate coffered ceiling, gilded Corinthian columns and drooping gold chandeliers. Nero, who conceived the original domus aurea, would feel right at home. Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will. On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden. So, having been here before, the American Institute of Architects is wearily wary, stating: “AIA is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities, mandate official federal design preferences, or otherwise hinder design freedom, and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings.” White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing, Richard Nixon installed a bowling lane and Harry S Truman commissioned an entire reconstruction. Several first ladies have revamped the decor and furnishings, notably Jackie Kennedy, whose soigné interiors were designed to connect the presidential home more resonantly with American history. The now doomed East Wing, dating from 1902, has been a much-changed addition. Intermittently housing the office of the first lady, what’s left of it sits above the presidential emergency operations centre, a high security bunker built during the second world war. Vice-president Dick Cheney and his retinue retreated there during the 9/11 attacks, as did Trump at the start of the George Floyd protests in 2020. The man who landed the ballroom job is James McCrery, founder of Washington-based McCrery Architects and a trenchant advocate of classical architecture. “Americans love classical architecture,” he has said, “because it is our formative architecture – and we love our nation’s formation.” Ironically, McCrery began his career working for Peter Eisenman, the high priest of deconstructivism, before a conversion of Damascene proportions prompted him to renounce the avant garde and “rethink his modernist education”. Specialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC. Trump’s style edicts and building bombast exude a dictator-for-life megalomania vibe, as he barrels through his second term, with an unconstitutional third potentially in his sights. However, he is said to dislike the White House, finding it on the poky side, preferring to decamp to his Floridian resort Mar-a-Lago at every opportunity. The tone for his latest stay in the White House was set by his patio-fication of the Rose Garden, but he is now clearly aiming for a legacy more substantial than a bit of paving. His record as a “patron” of architecture has been shaped by his rollercoaster career as a property developer. To him, buildings are simply extruded capital. He has an enduring fondness for Louis XIV bling, epitomised by his enrobing of a 1960s Manhattan skyscraper in golden bronze cladding to transform it into the gleamingly phallic Trump International Hotel and Tower. His more recent engoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared to a professional wrestler’s dressing room. Nonetheless, Trump’s experience as a developer was formative, in that it taught him he could get away with just about anything. It crystallised a poisonous bravado, now hardwired into the national political sphere. His fetishisation of classicism, a historically recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes, is bleakly predictable. “It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.” Another imperial wheeze, announced at a reception for prospective ballroom donors, is a huge triumphal arch, to be erected just across the Potomac river from the Lincoln Memorial. Modelled on the Parisian original and topped with a gilded, winged goddess of victory, the “Arc de Trump” is intended to commemorate the US’s 250th anniversary next year. In launching this newest vanity project, Trump said: “We love to fix up Washington.” Again, Nero would doubtless approve.",

    "article_text": "“The East End of London is the far right’s prime target – the essence of everything they don’t like. They feel if they can march through our borough with impunity, they can go anywhere. For them, it’s like Wembley (stadium), it’s the ultimate goal,” said Glyn Robbins, co-founder of United East End, an anti-far right coalition of community organisations. In the East End, the historically working-class neighbourhoods in the shadow of the City of London, there’s a feeling that history is repeating itself. It was 89 years ago this month that local people, many of them British Jews, drove out Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirt militia from Whitechapel in the East End, in what has become known as the Battle of Cable Street. In the decades since, the National Front, the BNP and the English Defence League have all tried to carve out a foothold in the East End. In 2025, communities are fighting back against the hard right yet again. This week, rather than attempting to escort protesters, as they had in Mosley’s day, London’s police stopped the hard right UK Independence Party (Ukip) from staging a “crusade on Whitechapel” in the borough of Tower Hamlets, where 40% of the population is Muslim and 14% were born in the EU. The Metropolitan police said the ban was to prevent “serious disorder.” It comes weeks after Tower Hamlets council passed a motion that said flags were “important emblems of patriotism and pride”, but condemned “outside far-right agitators … attempting to import division into our borough,” particularly on the Isle of Dogs, where the far-right BNP won a council seat back in 1993. Furious far-right influencer Tommy Robinson tweeted the photographs of nine British Muslim councillors to his 1.7 million followers, saying: “Here’s a list of the names and faces of Tower Hamlets council for some perspective.” The government’s decision to place asylum seekers at Britannia International Hotel in Canary Wharf, Tower Hamlets has attracted intense anti-migrant protest since the summer, including from a group called the Pink Ladies who say they are concerned about safety. While this weekend’s Ukip march has been stopped, counter-protesters still plan to gather in Whitechapel on Saturday. Dave Rosenberg, who has run walking tours through the East End since 2007, including on local anti-fascist history, will be among them. “I think we owe it to our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents to continue that struggle in the East End,” said Rosenberg, 67. For Rosenberg, the ban on the march was a “double-edged sword” – “a relief to the most targeted communities”, but also “giving wider and wider powers to police to say who can demonstrate and where”. “There’s a very direct parallel with the 1930s,” he said. In 1936, the Public Order Act was introduced to inhibit Mosley’s British Union of Fascists. Mosley’s wasn’t the first anti-immigrant movement to target the area – back in 1901, the British Brothers’ League (BBL) launched itself with a 1,000-strong rally in the East End, with the slogan “England for the English” and targeting Russian and Polish Jewish migrants. For Rosenberg, the repeated battle against the far right in the East End reflects two different visions of working-class life – one diverse, the other homogenous. “It’s this sense that those organisations have had, from BBL to Ukip today, that this is ‘our territory’… and people are invaders and encroaching in our territory,” Rosenberg said. Last week, Safia Jama, the 47-year-old CEO of the charity Women’s Inclusive Team, was chairing a Stand Up to Racism meeting when it was disrupted by rightwing protesters. “I did not feel safe. I never ran out of somewhere so quickly,” she said. When she was a young girl, her father was attacked in Tower Hamlets and left disabled as a result. The community has seen “huge achievements” since: Brick Lane and Spitalfields have experienced profound regeneration – and gentrification – and Canary Wharf is a leading financial centre. While 62.7% of all residents in employment are in managerial or professional occupations, the borough has the highest rate of child poverty in the country, with about 27,000 people on the housing list, and about 15,000 people in overcrowded homes. With a median age of 30, it is the youngest borough in England and Wales, as well as one of the UK’s most socially and ethnically diverse areas. “This is our home. We’ve made it our home,” Jama said. “We’ve invested tears, sweat, blood, whatever it might be, we’ve really worked hard to create an environment that is beautiful.” But for months, tensions have been simmering in Tower Hamlets, as rightwingers have made its diversity the centre of a culture war. The latest escalation began in February, when Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe tweeted about dual language signs in English and Bengali at Whitechapel tube station. “This is London,” he wrote. “The station name should be in English, and in English only.” Elon Musk replied: “Yes”. By June, Robinson was complaining about bilingual children in Whitechapel, adding “a district once synonymous with Jack the Ripper and the Kray twins and home to the nation’s true cockneys, now this.” Lutfur Rahman, Tower Hamlets’ British Bengali mayor, described the online attack as “despicable”. Rahman has defied controversies to lead the borough repeatedly since 2008, with progressive social policies. All primary and secondary schoolchildren enjoy free school meals, the borough provides university bursaries and the education maintenance allowance for working-class teenagers and is investing, the leadership says, £700m in council homes, funded by “taxing wealth, and high business rates for big business”. Rahman said: “In the late 1980s and early 90s, parts of the borough were no-go areas for people of colour. Since then successive leaders have invested in the people of the borough – and it’s worked well for us. We have over 300,000 people, we don’t want anyone to feel left out. “Now, 90% of our residents say they get one with each other. I grew up in this borough, our white neighbours helped my mother, helped me when my father went to work. My mum couldn’t speak English, it was our neighbours, the community spirit of the East End, that got us through those difficult days in the 70s and 80s.” In September, the borough hosted a festival to celebrate this legacy, in a direct response to Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rally in central London. New dual language signs were unveiled on the town hall – the restored former Royal London hospital – a snub to Lowe and Musk. Pearly kings and queens, a steel band, Celtic dancers, klezmer musicians, Bengali, Somali and Chinese acts performed and told stories of the East End through the ages, while a curry festival took place on Brick Lane, events attracting 25,000 people over two days. “The truth is, in the midst of all rancour and in the midst of all uncertainty, there is hope,” said Rev James Olanipekun, co-chair of the Tower Hamlets interfaith forum. “We are united and we are together.” Living in the borough has not been without incident for Olanipekun. Once, a brick was thrown at his wife’s car. “I didn’t look at it, I said nothing. After all, I was insured,” he said with a laugh. “Racism has a long history and Tower Hamlets, we’ve had a particular variant of it,” Robbins, a university lecturer who has seen off numerous far-right marches since United East End was created in 2010. “(But) now, what they’re saying is being echoed by the government, or the government in-waiting.”",

    "article_text": "Support for Reform UK among British Indians has tripled since the election, according to polling from a diaspora group that suggests Nigel Farage’s party is gaining ground in some demographics where it has struggled. Research by the 1928 Institute, a group of Oxford academics who analyse the British Indian community, shows backing for Reform has jumped in the past year from 4% to 13%. The findings, which are being released to coincide with Diwali, show support for Farage’s party among Britain’s largest minority ethnic community remains well below the national level. But the increase since the election is far higher than the national average, showing Reform is building momentum in communities where it has traditionally struggled. The report said: “British Indian support for Reform is significantly lower than that of the general UK population. However, there is a strong upwards trend in support.” British Indians, who form about 3% of the population, are becoming increasingly important swing voters. For decades they were closely allied with the Labour party, which was regarded as being more tolerant of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. But those ties have begun to fray as the community has become more established and its policy priorities have started to tally more closely with those of the rest of the population. Social conservatism among Indian voters and growing nationalism among Hindus in particular have helped drive them further right on the political spectrum, researchers say. A report in 2021 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found Labour’s support for Kashmiri independence during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership had been a particular turn-off for British Indian voters. Farage has expressed mixed views on south Asian immigration. The Reform leader criticised the government’s recent trade deal with India for making it easier to bring in workers from the subcontinent but said in 2015 that he preferred Indian and Australian migrants to those from eastern Europe. The findings from the 1928 Institute are taken from a report on the demographics and political priorities of the Indian community in the UK. The academics surveyed more than 2,000 voters earlier this year and compared the results with voting patterns last year and a similar poll carried out five years ago. They found that at the last election 48% of British Indians voted for Labour, 21% for the Conservatives and only 4% for Reform. At the election five years earlier, Reform won just 0.4% of the British Indian vote. Now, however, Labour support stands at 35% with the Indian community, while the Conservatives have collapsed to 18%. Support for the Greens has also risen sharply, especially among younger voters, going from 8% at the election to 13% now. The research shows the shift is being driven in part by changing policy priorities. While Indian voters always put education at the top of their concerns, their second priority has changed from health five years ago to the economy now. Their third priority is crime, having been the environment five years ago. Equalities and human rights has dropped from fifth on the list of priorities to seventh. Nikita Ved, a co-author of the report, said: “Reform UK’s rise is disrupting traditional voting patterns within the British Indian community. As economic and social frustrations deepen, both major parties may face growing pressure to engage more directly with a community whose political loyalties can no longer be taken for granted.”",

    "article_text": "One of UK’s most senior Jewish politicians has said he and the Jewish community are “heartbroken, frightened and angry” after the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue. Richard Hermer, the attorney general and a close ally of Keir Starmer in cabinet, said tackling a rising tide of antisemitism would require police protection and political leaders calling it out wherever it was found. The country’s most senior lawyer made the intervention in Jewish News, saying more must be done to tackle antisemitism and to bring communities together. “We are heartbroken. We are frightened. We are angry. The rising tide of antisemitism has been plain for all to see yet is too often explained away,” he wrote. “British Jews are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for the same thing every family, of every faith, should expect: to live and worship freely, without fear. That means, tragically in these times, police on the ground. It means protecting our schools and synagogues. And it means leaders in every party and community calling out antisemitism wherever it appears.” He said stepping up protections for Jewish communities was the right response but it “cannot be the end of the conversation”. “The focus will not just be on security and justice but on how we can bring communities together to heal from this. This government is determined to build a country where no minority has to live in fear and where antisemitism is confronted without hesitation, without qualification and without excuse.” Starmer issued a message to Jewish people on Thursday night pledging to “wrap arms” around the community in the wake of the attack. In a recorded message, Starmer said: “I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do … Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. “And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community. I promise you that over the coming days you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love.” Starmer, whose wife, Victoria, is Jewish, made tackling antisemitism in Labour a major priority after he became party leader.",

    "article_text": "The bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher by the sculptor Douglas Jennings has a rating of 2.8 out of five on Google Maps. Although curiously, none of the reviewers seems to have overly preoccupied themselves with the quality of the craftsmanship or the fidelity of the likeness. “One of the most important PMs this country ever had,” writes one. “It’s a public toilet but there’s nowhere to wash your hands,” writes another. The statue was originally commissioned more than a decade ago, and was intended to stand in front of the Houses of Parliament, but Westminster city council rejected it on the grounds that it might become a target for vandalism. Instead, it was offered to her birthplace of Grantham, a town she left at the age of 18 and rarely visited again. Within hours of its installation, someone threw an egg at it. Shortly after that, it was defaced with red paint. And now, on a grey October afternoon, Margaret Thatcher herself is gazing upon it, bearing a look of pure disgust. “They’ve got the date wrong,” she moans, her trademark handbag sliding down a blue-sleeved arm pointed accusingly upwards. “It says I died in 2013. As you can see, I am very much alive.” The presence of Thatcher in her home town, on what would have been her 100th birthday, has drawn a small crowd outside the town’s Guildhall Arts Centre. Motorists toot horns; fans want selfies; passersby occasionally flick V-signs from across the street. A middle-aged woman approaches and clasps Thatcher’s hands in her own. “I just want to say, if it weren’t for you, I would never have been able to buy my house.” “That’s wonderful,” Thatcher replies. “And are you still living in the house?” “No,” the woman says. “I sold it to my son.” Somehow it scarcely matters that the figure they are venerating and vilifying is not Thatcher at all, but an actor named Matt Tedford, who plays the former prime minister in a riotous drag show called Margaret Thatcher: Queen of Soho, which played at the Guildhall on Monday night. In the show, Britain’s first female prime minister is depicted walking the streets of London on the night before the section 28 vote in parliament in 1987, stumbling upon a gay bar and ultimately reinventing herself as a disco diva. It’s sharp, topical, ridiculous and very funny. Tedford has been portraying Thatcher for 12 years – “longer than she was prime minister”, he observes wryly. The role has taken him to some strange and random places. He’s met party leaders. He’s been for dinner at the Foreign Office. He’s shared a stage with Kemi Badenoch at a book launch. For a character that began life as a gaudy Halloween costume around the start of the last decade, it’s been quite a ride. As he puts it: “I always say I’m the only northerner she ever gave work to.” Now his work has brought him to Thatcher Fest: a clever wheeze cooked up by Grantham’s local councillors to commemorate the centenary of its most famous daughter. There are talks and walks, Thatcher-themed music nights and exhibitions of memorabilia, Gyles Brandreth giving a lecture on Thatcher’s unlikely connection to Winnie-the-Pooh, exhibitions of her exercise books at the local school and newspaper clippings at the library. It’s attracted all sorts: Queen of Soho was uproariously received by a largely progressive crowd, while the true-blue diehards packed out the Guildhall for a talk by Edwina Currie, asking reliably bone-headed questions about what Thatcher would have made of “today’s political correctness”. Not everything has been a riotous success: one of the walking tours at the weekend attracted just five people. But for a small town known to most as a stop on the East Coast Main Line, it is the spotlight they crave. “Grantham has never had as much publicity as it has this week,” boasts Ashley Baxter, the independent leader of the local South Kesteven district council. “Having Queen of Soho upset the Conservatives. Having a Thatcher Fest at all upset the left. We’re upsetting all the right people. Which is only right, because people are still … very emotional about her.” On a wider level, the anniversary has been marked with the usual spume of reassessment, revisionism, tie-in content and outright silliness. The phrase “whatever you thought of her politics” has been flogged to within an inch of its life. At the recent Tory conference in Manchester, their former leader was a weirdly pervasive, almost phantasmagorical presence in the hall: cardboard cutouts, a photo mosaic, an AI Thatcher, her outfits displayed in a glass case. There has been a new book alleging that she had two extramarital affairs, a birthday gala dinner in London, an Unherd article on Thatcher’s “erotic power” that describes her as “a nursery dominatrix, thrashing grown-up little boys who confuse punishment with love”. More than three decades after she left politics, it seems there are still plenty desperate to reanimate her by incantation. And there is a certain irony here, for during her time Thatcher was largely uninterested in furnishing the iconography or cult of personality that grew around her: a life, as her biographer Charles Moore observed, “unexamined by the person who lived it”. She was unmoved by questions of legacy, never kept a diary, threw away huge piles of her documents. She wanted to be consequential. But she was never overly fussed about her place in history. And so what remains of Thatcher today is essentially a palimpsest; a dirty print of projected feelings and half-remembered catchphrases, slavish adoration and bogeyman hatred. This is doubly true for subsequent generations with no actual memories of her. “You meet lots of young people who think they should hate Thatcher, but don’t necessarily know who she was, what effect she had on their lives,” says Tedford. “They know she closed the mines. They know about the milk. There’s a remove there, where we’ve been able to appraise her differently to a generation who grew up with her as a present-tense villain.” Naturally enough, current politics also intrude here, as Thatcher’s old party stands on the brink of collapse, as traditional institutions lie in ruins, as a surging far right evoke her memory while simultaneously running from her libertarian brand of small-state economics. And of course it is only natural to wonder what she would have made of the rise of Reform and open blood-and-soil nativism, the St George’s flags brandished forebodingly from the upstairs windows of Grantham’s narrow terraced houses. Is this what she wanted? Is the new far right a continuation of Thatcherism, or a reaction against it? “Thatcher remains part of Grantham’s story, and rightly so,” says Ben Green, a Reform councillor who defected from the Conservatives this summer, in an email. “But the challenges we face today are very different from those of the 1980s. Her reforms revived enterprise but left too many industrial towns behind. In my view, the country now needs a more patriotic and muscular state: pro-enterprise, yes. But also pro-community.” Moore doesn’t, on a point of principle, answer hypotheticals about what Thatcher might have done or believed today. But there are elements of Reform’s current appeal that, he suggests, did not chime with hers. “She was not interested in racial stuff at all,” he says. “And of course she was completely against repatriation, which she thought was inhumane, and also sort of nonsensical.” Back in Grantham, Currie has just finished giving a talk on Thatcher and feminism to an audience of enraptured diehards and a few dozen extremely bored-looking schoolchildren on a field trip. Baxter, the council leader, is in his office reflecting on Thatcher’s true legacy in the town. And for all its gilded heritage, this is a place with largely familiar issues: closing shops, a shortage of housing, a shrunken civic life, a basic absence of identity. “My colleagues will walk down the London Road and say: ‘Oh, that used to be a machining place. That used to be a factory. That was where so many people worked.’ But this is the story of the UK. “Then on the high street, you’ll see we’ve got our fair share of empty shops,” Baxter continues. “We’re trying to put works of art into them. And because of Thatcher, and the subsequent austerity governments, you’re only allowed art by stealth. If I said tomorrow we needed an arts officer on a salary of £30,000, the answer would – correctly – be that we haven’t got any money. Same with leisure. I’m in this job because the Tories shut down my local leisure centre in 2021 and we’re trying to find a way to reopen it.” Perhaps the most generous view of Thatcher is that she was a prime minister with no real concept of the long-term consequences of her actions. Perhaps she genuinely did believe that her wave of liberalisations would secure the greatest comfort for the greatest number, a little patriotic paradise in which everyone would own their own house and a little nest egg in British Telecom shares. Perhaps she failed to properly anticipate the storm of globalisation, the way it ripped the soul out of communities and created a staggering concentration of wealth among a very few. Perhaps you might even argue that, given the prevailing global currents of the 1980s, if it wasn’t Thatcher, it would have been someone else. But, of course, it was Thatcher, a naturally combative politician who saw ideological enemies at every turn, urgent and angry and unafraid of disruption. And perhaps the real legacy of her time is the death of the principle that we could all somehow prosper together. More than any other figure in our lifetime, Thatcher embedded the idea that our own circumstances can only ever be improved at the expense of someone else, by picking the right side and fighting for eternity, the politics of envy and cruelty and vindictiveness baked into our electoral calculus. You will be fine, because others will not. Perhaps this is why on some level people still want her to be real, to berate her or whisper sweet nothings in her ear, and are prepared to elide the infinite layers of makeup, artifice and literal death in order to do so. But of course the woman herself has largely disappeared from view. You can’t throw an egg at deregulation. You can’t hurl paint over decades of rising house prices. The devastated former industrial towns of the north, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales possess precious little erotic dominatrix power. Back to Grantham rail station we go, past the statue of another local hero, Isaac Newton (Google rating: 4.7), dodging the four lanes of traffic and a deregulated local bus as we cross the road outside the big Wetherspoons. On the other side, a shuttered cafe sits alongside a branch of the local estate agents, the latter staffed by young men and women wearing suits and headsets. Thatcher’s old school is now an academy. The station car park is now run by a private firm and charges £5.45 for 24 hours. Inside the station there is a choice of Costa or Starbucks. Maybe Tedford was right after all: it says she died in 2013, but as you can see, she is very much alive.",
    "summary_text": "Somehow it scarcely matters that the figure they are venerating and vilifying is not Thatcher at all, but an actor named Matt Tedford, who plays the former prime minister in a riotous drag show called Margaret Thatcher: Queen of Soho, which played at the Guildhall on Monday night. Baxter, the council leader, is in his office reflecting on Thatcher’s true legacy in the town. Thatcher’s old school is now an academy. Naturally enough, current politics also intrude here, as Thatcher’s old party stands on the brink of collapse, as traditional institutions lie in ruins, as a surging far right evoke her memory while simultaneously running from her libertarian brand of small-state economics. There are talks and walks, Thatcher-themed music nights and exhibitions of memorabilia, Gyles Brandreth giving a lecture on Thatcher’s unlikely connection to Winnie-the-Pooh, exhibitions of her exercise books at the local school and newspaper clippings at the library. Tedford has been portraying Thatcher for 12 years – “longer than she was prime minister”, he observes wryly. A middle-aged woman approaches and clasps Thatcher’s hands in her own."

    "article_text": "“I remember my father marching against the National Front in the 1970s. It felt like it was a minority. The majority of people are still decent. But now, the far right seems legitimised and popular,” Dabinderjit Singh, a retired senior civil servant said. Singh was reacting to Tommy Robinson’s 13 September far-right “unite the kingdom” rally, which drew 110,000 people to London. The rally’s attenders say they have a variety of concerns. But for some ethnic minority Britons, Saturday’s scenes were reminiscent of far-right marches 50 years ago. Hetticia McIntosh, 70, from Manchester, was returning from holiday via Heathrow when she was warned by a WhatsApp “community safety alert”, to “avoid travelling into London … especially if you are from an ethnic minority.” For ex-servicewoman McIntosh, the times evoke memories of her east London, Windrush generation youth – when “we lived through the skinheads” and racial abuse was daubed on walls. McIntosh knows exactly where racist sentiment can lead. The Home Office inexplicably refused to renew her and her husband’s British passports in the 1970s and 1980s, forcing them to leave the country for St Lucia for decades. She now fears, amid talk of “remigration” from the far right, hardening attitudes to legal migration in Westminster and a government struggling to convey a positive message of unity, that “another Windrush scandal” could happen. This year far-right groups have capitalised on asylum hotel protests, while the “raise the colours” campaign has led to St George’s and union flags being flown from lampposts and painted on roundabouts nationwide. While for many, the flags are a celebration of national pride, St George’s crosses have been grafittied, sometimes with slurs, on ethnic minority-owned businesses and places of worship including a Manchester church, a Reading mosque and a York Chinese takeaway. Last week, police in Oldbury, West Midlands received a report that a Sikh woman had been violently sexually assaulted and told: “You don’t belong here, get out.” Robinson condemned the attack, saying shortly before the rally there was a distinction between “bad scumbags” and “decent minorities”, and that “as we attempt to unite this kingdom against mass immigration … I will speak personally of the sacrifices and great contribution that the Sikh community have made to Great Britain.” For Singh, among community leaders dealing with the attack’s aftermath, Robinson’s remarks are part of a “divide and rule” tactic in which the right has tried to “cozy up to Sikhs” and contrast them with Muslims, while Sikhs with “turbans and beards” were increasingly targeted in racial attacks after 9/11. “I think we are in more worrying, dangerous times than the 70s,” Singh said. “We have people playing on the sentiments of the majority in many countries – not just the UK, but the US, Europe, in India.” The rhetoric, in and out of Westminster, is leaving some ethnic minority Britons with long memories wondering how far things could go. Labour proposes doubling the standard qualifying period for settled status for legal, taxpaying skilled migrants from five years to 10 years. Last week, Tory MP Katie Lam said this was “not enough”, adding: “No new visa should be issued to, no new ILR [indefinite leave to remain] status should be granted to, and existing ILR status should be revoked from those who have committed a crime, accessed state support or are unlikely to contribute more than they cost. Those who have no legal way to stay here would then need to leave.” McIntosh, who has already experienced the Windrush scandal’s unofficial “remigration” scheme said: “History is repeating itself. That should frighten us all. Because no society can move forward if it keeps repeating the same prejudice. “We deserve dignity, not fear, in our later years. The more things change, the more they remain the same. When I saw that rally in London, it brought me right back. It’s heartbreaking. It’s down to a lack of teaching. If you did not go there, we would not be here.” Nigel Bromage, founder of counter-extremism group Exit Hate, also hears history’s echoes. He was in the National Front and Combat 18 in the 1980s and 1990s, before turning his back on neo-nazism. He said: “We are living in dark times – we ignore these signs at our peril. While the London rally was presented as an inclusive event, it attracted not only frustrated and unheard individuals but also hardcore British nationalists and neo-Nazis, all of whom seek to spread their message. “The underlying conditions for such movements – economic inequality, social grievances and a sense of disenfranchisement – have all been present for some time.” The prospect of a far-right, Elon Musk-backed government no longer seems unthinkable, a representative of the UK Indian Muslim Council said. “Minorities feel trapped,” he said. “Like they don’t belong anywhere. I was driving recently with my wife by my side and someone rolled down their window, called me [the p-word] and drove off.” The British Muslim Trust (BMT), the government’s new Islamophobia monitoring partner, says the atmosphere is deeply concerning. BMT chief executive, Akeela Ahmed, added: “There is no question that events like Saturday – which saw divisive rhetoric and despicable levels of violence – are causing deep unease. “We have had multiple reports of Muslim women taking extra precautions in recent weeks, with many choosing to stay at home on Saturday. This is intolerable.” For Singh, there is concern that the government is unable or unwilling to tackle racism. “I want [home secretary] Shabana Mahmood, as a Muslim woman, not simply to focus on immigration, but deal with racism and attacks against women. “If she fails in that, then I think the writing is on the wall that we don’t have a political leadership that can get out of the ballot box politics authoritarian states go towards, which is please the majority and penalise minorities.” Meanwhile, anti-racist campaigners the Runnymede Trust fear mainstream politicians have “lost control of this narrative to the likes of (Elon) Musk” after “legitimising racism”. They added: “It is significant that Saturday was also Stephen Lawrence’s birthday. Racism kills.” Angela Rayner was developing a social cohesion strategy before her resignation. A spokesperson for the communities department said: “Racism is completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. “We are determined to bridge divisions between communities and the work of the social cohesion taskforce will continue, reporting to the prime minister.”",

    "article_text": "Some primal energy was unleashed among Nigerian artists in the years leading up to independence. The century-long reign of colonialism was nearing its end and the people of Nigeria, with its over 300 tribes, its ebullient energy, were poised for a new future in which they would determine the shape and context of their lives. And the people who most articulated that double position, that paradox of modernity and tradition, were artists in all their stripes. Artists across the country, in constant dialogue with one another, created works that evoked their traditions but in a contemporary context. Artists such as Yusuf Grillo in the north, Bruce Onobrakpeya from the midwest, Ben Enwonwu from the east and Twins Seven Seven from the west were remaking the dream of art in a rigorously Nigerian context. The effect of the works created by the Zaria Art Society, the generation that congregated in Lagos and exhibited all over the world, was profound. Their work helped the nation to reconnect with its ancient ways, but adapted to modern times. It was a new art, brooding and celebratory. Often it was an art that hinted at the many dimensions of Nigerian mythology; often it drew upon daily realities. Spirits, ancestral presences, rituals, masquerades featured prominently, alongside popular subjects of dancing figures, portraits and landscapes, but rendered in a unique light, with a palette that was utterly unlike anything in the western tradition. It is important to stress that these were not artists creating in isolation. They were in touch with the currents of world art, as can be seen by the responses to cubism in many works of sculpture. It was not a response as such but a taking back, a retrieval, of what cubism took from Africa. The other area in which this Nigerian modernism revealed itself is in the Nigerian novel. Works such as Chinua Achebe’s seminal Things Fall Apart, Wole Soyinka’s The Interpreters and Amos Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard are all works that depict a nation fermenting with energy and cultural tensions. Christopher Okigbo wrote in Labyrinths, 1967, that “We carry in our worlds that flourish / Our worlds that have failed.” But the opposite is also true. We carry in our worlds that have failed, our worlds that flourish. Two important contemporary events bear this out. The much-awaited opening of the art museum in the ancient city of Benin, MOWAA (Museum of West African Art), may be the single most important event in African art since the infamous burning of African works of art by the British in that same city, in 1897. The other is the Tate Modern in London’s upcoming exhibition, Nigerian Modernism, which aims to spotlight Nigeria’s contribution to the wider story of modern art and British culture. Nigerian writers and artists in Britain have been a vital part of that story, not least Ben Enwonwu, who sojourned here during the Nigerian civil war and sculpted Queen Elizabeth II in the 50s. For almost 100 years, figures such as Uzo Egonu, Demas Nwoko and Bruce Onobrakpeya have shaped the visual and intellectual life of these isles. The tradition continues with artists such as El Anatsui, who has expanded the possibilities of global sculpture with his monumental works, and ceramicist Ladi Kwali, who alchemised Nigerian craft and modern design. They have extended the story of Nigerian modernism into contemporary times, bringing about a renewal not only in the art and literature of Africa but of Britain also. Ben Okri Artist Yinka Shonibare on Sade Adu For me, Sade Adu is a perfect example of the British-Nigerian creative spirit. She fused jazz, soul and pop into something that was entirely her own, not copying anyone, but creating a new sound. That is what Nigerian modernism does too: it makes something new out of history. I grew up between Lagos and London, and used to pay frequent visits to Lagos’s National Museum, which is where I first saw Ben Enwonwu’s sculpture Anyanwu. It was powerful, uplifting and deeply connected to Nigerian identity, and left a lasting impression on me, even as a child. In 1977, when I was a teenager, Nigeria hosted the landmark Festival of Black Arts and Culture, and the National Theatre in Lagos was full of newly commissioned work: stained glass, carvings, monumental installations. It was a formative experience, showing me that art could tell the story of a nation. Nigerian modernism is, in many ways, about identity – about how to live with the legacy of colonialism and create something that feels both contemporary and connected to the past. That question has shaped my own work, too. Being British-Nigerian means you are constantly navigating both worlds, which is ripe for creative opportunity. This is why the Tate exhibition is so important. For too long, African art has been viewed through the lens of European artists who were influenced by it, such as Picasso. This exhibition centres Nigerian artists on their own terms. I think part of the reason that British-Nigerians are so overrepresented in the creative industries is because, for many of us, success was the only option. Your parents certainly didn’t bring you to the UK to fail, so there is that cultural drive and discipline which breeds ambition. Labour MP Chi Onwurah on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie If I had to choose one piece of Nigerian art which has affected me the most, it would be Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It is about the Nigerian civil war in the 60s, which separated my family. My parents never spoke about it, so reading that book in 2006 was a seminal moment for me – it gave voice to a history that had shaped my life but was never spoken about. I grew up in Newcastle in the 70s and 80s, and there was no exposure to Nigerian or British-Nigerian art or artists. My school friends would make fun of the idea of Nigerian or African art. We sought out representation wherever we could. There’s a dynamism in Nigerian culture that I think was suppressed for decades by a lack of opportunity and acceptance in the UK. It was only when I lived in Lagos in the early 2000s that I saw the incredible range of Nigerian artists. Their work was so alive, and it also revealed the blandness of European artists like Picasso’s take on African visual expressionism. Some of my favourite artists are featured in the Tate’s exhibition, including Yinka Shonibare. I remember seeing his early works in London Underground stations more than 20 years ago – his depictions of historical European figures wearing west African cloth were extraordinary. They brought together two worlds that seemed separate but were deeply connected through colonialism and slavery. Bruce Onobrakpeya’s use of materials like circuit boards also resonates with me as a trained engineer, too. Historian Alayo Akinkugbe on Fela Kuti I loved discovering Fela Kuti as a teenager – the way he performed shirtless, in vibrant costumes, and spoke truth to power. I’d grown up with the idea that we always had to be very cautious of not wanting to say too much when it came to politics. His music – a fusion of jazz, funk and Yoruba rhythms – became a soundtrack and a rallying cry for resistance, and he taught me that Nigerians can be unapologetically outspoken and creative, something that feels even more urgent for my generation. With the huge #EndSars movement which took place in Nigeria in 2020, protesting against police brutality, there has been a new wave of political activism among young people, and it’s useful to have the blueprint of someone like Fela. Similarly, Ben Enwonwu’s work was everywhere when I was growing up – his Africa Dances series, with its elegant, dancing figures, perfectly captured the post-independence mood. My grandfather was a friend of his, so we had his paintings at home. Yusuf Grillo was another formative influence – his monumental crowd and market scenes have stayed with me since childhood and shaped the way I think about colour and scale. A turning point in the recognition of Nigerian modernism came in 2018, when Enwonwu’s portrait Tutu sold at Bonhams for £1.2m. Suddenly, Nigerian art was being taken seriously by the global art market. Questions of ownership inevitably come up in the British-Nigerian context. The Benin bronzes are the most famous example, but there are thousands of looted works in European collections. The Tate exhibition will inevitably reopen these questions, as will the landmark opening of MOWAA in Benin. There will be a major cultural institution in Nigeria ready to house repatriated works, which forces us to ask: who should these objects belong to? Artist Joy Labinjo on Njideka Akunyili Crosby The artist who has inspired me most is Njideka Akunyili Crosby. I saw her work for the first time at the Venice Biennale in 2013, and it felt like coming home. Her focus on family, domestic life and memory gave me the confidence to know that my own experiences were enough, and that I could build a career making work that is unapologetically personal. I make figurative paintings that explore identity, memory and family, often drawing on my own Nigerian-British heritage. My practice began with looking backwards – at family photographs, Nigerian parties, rich fabrics – and translating those memories into paint. Studying British painting techniques and historic composition gave me the tools to fuse these experiences with my British identity, and that fusion became the language I use as an artist today. It wasn’t until my mid-20s that I began discovering Black artists – specifically Nigerian ones – because art education largely ignored them. In the last five years or so, Nigeria’s cultural presence has grown significantly. Afrobeats went global around a decade ago, and the visual arts followed, with young diaspora artists finding their voices. Nigerians are, fundamentally, hustlers. I think that is why the diaspora is so prolific in the creative space: a natural drive, a strong work ethic and a community that supports one another. Being in the UK has given more access, but our ambition is rooted in culture. Poet Inua Ellams on Wole Soyinka Yinka Shonibare is an artist who continually inspires me, as do Caleb Femi’s interdisciplinary practices, which have been formative. In terms of music, Sunny Ade and Fela Kuti transport me across time and space. Contemporary artists such as Victor Ehikhamenor inspire me – his abstract, symbol-charged work feels like African morse code. I still search for meaning in it, even when it feels incomprehensible, and that search is satisfying. I also have to mention Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman, which demonstrates the power of storytelling to address post-colonial politics. The play is now a staple for the Black and west African literati, but it was so far ahead of its time in the themes it discussed. Soyinka was the first African writer to win the Nobel prize for literature in 1986, and he is still probably the most influential Nigerian writer alive today. From an early age my creativity was shaped by the clothes my parents wore – tailored fabrics, bold colours and patterns that fused Nigerian and Muslim aesthetics. I remember wearing my mother’s blue wrapper over a T-shirt emblazoned with my name and running around calling myself “Nigerian Superman”. Those early experiments in cloth, colour and storytelling formed the foundation of my artistic sensibility. Moving to the UK, my sense of identity became inseparable from the immigrant experience. Living under Theresa May’s hostile environment policy and anti-immigrant rhetoric made it impossible to claim full Britishness. I clung to Nigerian culture while negotiating a space within Britain’s creative landscape. Nigeria is a particular hotbed of pressure and hustle mentality, which forces creativity. There is also so much creative exchange within the diaspora, and that collaboration fills the creative coffers creators draw from. Rising incomes for second-generation Nigerians have also meant that their parents stopped insisting they become doctors or lawyers and began encouraging creative endeavours. Novelist Diana Evans on Mary Evans If there was one artist who has inspired me the most, it would be my sister, Mary Evans. She is a fine artist, explores colonial history and the transatlantic slave trade in her paper works. Her piece Hold, with its tiny, intricate figures, is subtle, poignant and political, and it hangs on a wall in my house. It’s a representation of the hold of a slave ship, and is incredibly evocative but in a very quiet way. She has always been a huge inspiration to me, and it still feels like a huge privilege to have her work in my home. I see a parallel in Nigerian modernism and the way I approach my work as a novelist. The modernists’ ability to fuse African traditions with western techniques mirrors my own approach to narrative: blending British literary forms with Nigerian diasporic experience. I first encountered Nigerian literature seriously in my early-20s through Ben Okri. His dreamlike, bold storytelling opened a world of possibility – just the complexity, the richness, the boldness of it. He showed me these fantastic landscapes and worlds you could take the reader into, just through the power of sentences. Visual art also continues to inform me. Chris Ofili’s No Woman, No Cry, dedicated to Stephen Lawrence, is a work I return to again and again. Music is another constant influence. Nigerian artists such as Wizkid, and British-Nigerian musicians such as Tinie Tempah and Dave, bring an energy and confidence that I try to bring to my writing. Ezra Collective trumpeter-composer Ife Ogunjobi on Skepta A song which has particularly influenced me is Energy (Stay Far Away) by Skepta and Wizkid. Beyond the music itself, it represents collaboration and unity between London and Nigeria – Skepta is always outspoken about his Nigerian heritage, and makes a big deal about going back to visit. The music video too, which is filmed partly in Nigeria, highlights the dialogue between our two worlds. Nigerians are very proud, outspoken, loud people. If a Nigerian has something to say, best believe you’re going to hear it, whether you like it or not. And I think that has a lot to do with why there are so many of us across the creative sphere. Particularly in London, there’s a huge Nigerian influence – everything from restaurants to fashion to music. We all have something to say, and we’re impossible to escape. And rightfully so, because our culture is so beautiful and diverse. My music is a fusion of the sounds I grew up with: Nigerian highlife, Fuji, Afrobeats. Artists such as Ebenezer Obey and King Sunny Adé, alongside modern influences such as Wizkid and Burna Boy, and British sounds such as grime and UK rap. I also see Nigerian influence a lot more in fashion and visual art – I love Yinka Ilori’s work, for example. Poet Theresa Lola on Niyi Osundare For me, poetry has been the primary bridge connecting me to Nigeria, especially as someone who doesn’t speak Yoruba. Niyi Osundare’s poetry has been formative in showing how Nigerian writers can speak to universal themes while remaining deeply rooted in their culture. Similarly, the work of Prof Molara Ogundipe and Gabriel Okara demonstrates how experimentation within tradition can generate new forms of expression. In my work, I draw heavily on Yoruba literary forms, particularly the Oriki, a traditional praise poetry form, and Yoruba proverbs. Oriki are names, phrases or poetic expressions passed down through generations, often used to honour lineage, celebrate achievements or preserve memory. These forms provide a rhythm, structure and depth that English alone cannot capture, and they have become a language for me, a way to inhabit Nigerian heritage even without speaking the language fluently. The duality of my heritage informs what I find most urgent in my work, navigating the multiple aspects of my identity. I am Nigerian, I am Black, I am British, I am a woman. These intersecting experiences bring different urgencies and curiosities into my poetry, which becomes a space where these influences and perspectives melt together. Nigerian Modernism is at Tate Modern, London, 8 October to 10 May.",
    "summary_text": "A turning point in the recognition of Nigerian modernism came in 2018, when Enwonwu’s portrait Tutu sold at Bonhams for £1.2m. Suddenly, Nigerian art was being taken seriously by the global art market. Some primal energy was unleashed among Nigerian artists in the years leading up to independence. This exhibition centres Nigerian artists on their own terms. It was only when I lived in Lagos in the early 2000s that I saw the incredible range of Nigerian artists. Nigerian artists such as Wizkid, and British-Nigerian musicians such as Tinie Tempah and Dave, bring an energy and confidence that I try to bring to my writing. If I had to choose one piece of Nigerian art which has affected me the most, it would be Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It was powerful, uplifting and deeply connected to Nigerian identity, and left a lasting impression on me, even as a child."

    "article_text": "I have always been interested in gender and identity stories. In South Africa, we have a strong liberal constitution on paper for queer rights, but the reality on the streets – the hate crimes, the animosity in the workplace and in social settings – is very different. I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. That led me to the drag pageant scene. I would go to photograph pageants every weekend, and every Monday I would get messages from the people I’d photographed asking me to send the pictures – so I had a lot of instant feedback on the work I was making. I was using harsh lighting to play with the idea of masculine and feminine, to emphasise the contrast between the strong jawlines and the feminine personae. But there’s no one more honest than a drag queen, and very early on, someone told me they really didn’t like the picture I’d taken of them. It was hard to hear, but letting go of my ego I asked this person why. They said it was because they didn’t look beautiful. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. I changed my approach. And if I hadn’t had that knock to my ego, the work wouldn’t have become what it needed to be. Over the next year and a half, making the work became a conversation with the drag queens. I put it out there that I wanted to do a collaborative project. Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. The idea was to work with other drag artists and visit places where acts of violence had happened, and to reclaim these places. I told Belinda to think about who should tell this story – I wanted her to consider carefully if I was the right person. Two weeks later, she came back and said she wanted to work with me. I was concerned for the drag queens’ safety, not only while going to these sites of violence and making the images but also after, as some of them lived in the townships where the portraits would be made. I sat with it for a while. But one thing Belinda said stuck with me. She said: “If we don’t go, if we don’t reclaim these spaces and make these pictures, then it’s like we don’t exist.” The entire series was shot in four hours. We met at a petrol station on the day, so the drag queens could get ready – everyone had specific ideas about what they wanted to wear. We moved quickly and didn’t linger. I was definitely nervous – it made me realise how these people feel every day, you can never fully relax. I photographed Belinda at the shisanyama – a community space where women cook and sell meat – in Khayelitsha, a township located on the Cape Flats, near Cape Town. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was the end of the day and the light was really good – everything came together, with the lady in the background staring. If you look carefully, you can see my shadow – I love that I’m a part of it, that always makes me smile. Belinda has such a regal, enigmatic presence. There’s something about her – I hope it comes across in the image. Afterwards we organised a show at a community hall in Khayelitsha. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It’s amazing to have global exposure for the issues we care about, but none of that is as valuable as showing the work in the space it was created. Lee-Ann Olwage’s CV Born: Durban, 1986 Trained: “I’m a self-trained photographer but studied film directing at AFDA film school in Cape Town.” Influences: “My peers, life, the stories I work on, and other forms of storytelling: painting, music, weaving, textile art.” High point: “Winning the World Press Photo award in 2020. It wasn’t so much the award but the fact that people celebrated a story I loved and my way of seeing the world. It gave me a new confidence that helped me take the next steps in my career.” Low point: “Working with a journalist who was not respectful of the community we were in. I still resent myself for not speaking up about the situation sooner.” Top tip: “Surround yourself with people doing what they love.” • This image is part of the World Press Photo print sale, 17-26 November, in celebration of World Press Photo at 70",
    "summary_text": "Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. This image is part of the World Press Photo print sale, 17-26 November, in celebration of World Press Photo at 70 I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It wasn’t so much the award but the fact that people celebrated a story I loved and my way of seeing the world."

    "article_text": "Phil Wang was about to get his hands on the championship belt. He was claiming the prize for Clash of the Comics, the bombastic night that throws comedians and pro wrestlers into the ring, when Ed Gamble stormed in, knocked everyone out, and swanned off with the belt. “Well,” corrects the comedian and Clash co-founder Max Olesker, “we were knocked down by his henchman.” Hulking pro wrestler Bullit was the one to clothesline him and his comedy partner, Ivan Gonzalez. “I think I could have taken Ed if he’d been on his own,” huffs Olesker. The popularity of pro wrestling has fluctuated since its golden era in the 1980s. At the start of this year, WWE made the leap on to Netflix with an eye-watering $5bn (£4bn) deal, inching the skimpily clad, heavily muscled combat sport higher in the public consciousness. In Britain, it has a rich working-class history, growing from the grassroots to raising some of the greatest international contenders such as Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr. Now, wrestling is dipping a greased-up toe into the theatrical limelight, with a smattering of productions across the UK welcoming new audiences through alternative performance lenses, from comedy to queer cabaret to a living sculpture that uses bondage to suspend disbelief. Olesker, who used to be the UK’s youngest pro wrestler as Max Voltage, was the one to introduce Gonzalez to wrestling, putting on a match in the student union at university. “The atmosphere was electric,” Gonzalez remembers. “It’s this larger-than-life pantomime: good versus evil.” Forming a comedy duo together as Max &amp; Ivan, the pair decided to blend the art forms for a show at the Edinburgh fringe, convincing pro wrestlers that they weren’t making fun of them and persuading comedians to throw themselves off the ropes. The Wrestling, as it was then called, won the Edinburgh comedy award and has rocketed in popularity since. Renamed Clash of the Comics, the brutal showdown that saw Rosie Jones defeat Greg Davies at the O2, as part of the 2023 Just for Laughs festival, is about to take over the Hammersmith Apollo, west London, where for the first time it will stand outside a wider comedy festival. The lineup includes pro wrestlers Simon Miller, Cara Noir and La Cyclonica, with comedians Aisling Bea, Flo &amp; Joan and James Acaster, who has issued an open challenge to any comedian or wrestler willing to take him on. And, naturally, Wang needs to win his championship belt back from Gamble. Commentating from the sidelines, Nish Kumar will be cheering for the rule-breaking baddies, Sara Pascoe will support the good and righteous, and Greg James will give an impartial play-by-play. Comedy is key to the night, but the show’s success relies on the spectacles in the ring. “They’re both performance art,” Olesker considers. “You travel the world, you react to an audience. It’s a real meeting of disciplines.” Logistically, the event is a nightmare. The comedians are sent to wrestling school to make their transformations possible. “I guess in the same way that Strictly Come Dancing teaches the celebrities not to become professional dancers, but to dance a very specific dance,” Gonzalez says, “we teach our comedians to wrestle for one specific moment.” The comics often come with ambitions of spectacular moves, which the team do their best to realise. “And much like Strictly,” Olesker adds, “all our wrestlers and comedians are having affairs with one another.” He keeps a straight face. “It just makes the whole thing fly.” Wrestling walks a constant tightrope between reality and pretence. “You’re training your body to be an athlete,” says Heather Bandenberg, who runs Fist Club, an LGBTQ+ cabaret night pitched as “Wrestling but gayer”. Melding queer performance and pro wrestling, the night features back-flipping drag kings, anarchic performances from pro wrestlers and an openness to the types of bodies that tend to be excluded from the mainstream. “You’re training to be a gymnast and you’re doing elements of stunt,” Bandenberg says. “It hurts.” One of the early moves a wrestler learns is how to “bump”, the classic move where they throw themselves on to the floor in order to imitate the impact of being thrown by someone else. The impact is real, even if the weight distribution and choreography lessen the pain. “There is an element of danger,” says Bandenberg. The liveness exaggerates this, as shows teeter between planned and improvised. “It’s one of the few performance art forms where the reaction of the crowd informs what will happen,” says Olesker. “People won’t do an extra scene in a Shakespeare play if people are really into it.” Bandenberg stumbled upon wrestling by accident, quickly falling for the space it allowed her to take up. “WWE has never been a great place to be a woman,” she says. “I saw the main world of wrestling and was like: This isn’t for me. But I found I wasn’t the only person who felt like this.” She formed the event with pro wrestling drag kings Rich Tea and Rocky Rhodes. For them, the collaboration between wrestling and cabaret seemed obvious. “Wrestling is drag,” Bandenberg says. “You have an alter ego. You’re getting the audience on your side.” Run for queer and female wrestlers, Fist Club leaps between venues across the UK and sells out fast, with some audience members having been persuaded to start wrestling themselves. Primarily featuring smack-talking drag kings, the night has a quota of 10% of straight male wrestlers: “Because that’s what it’s like to be a woman or queer person on a normal wrestling show.” The audience of their last show included a vicar in her 60s, who apparently had a glorious time. “We want it to be open to people who have never seen wrestling before,” Bandenberg says. A successful match relies on the sell: the performance. “You’re trying to make the audience believe you’re actually getting, you know, completely totalled in the face,” Bandenberg explains while miming knocking herself out. All the hosts are careful to make everything as safe as possible for their shows, but injuries aren’t uncommon. Olesker broke his ankle in the first show. In training, Bandenburg jumped off the top rope and broke both her big toes. “But I’ve got off lightly,” she shrugs. In Glasgow, the speed of a typical wrestling match is being frozen in time for a new piece of performance art. Luke George and Daniel Kok are the artists behind Still Lives, an installation using shibari, a rope-knotting bondage technique typically used in kink practice, to construct still images in the air. Adapting the piece to every city it moves to, they wrap people up, heave them high and suspend them, creating these breathing images with Australian rules players in Melbourne and rugby union players in Auckland. They are particularly interested in using underrepresented bodies. It’s not always sport; in Venice they wrapped up a gondolier. “We’re looking for something that can give us a sense of what life is like in that city,” says Kok. In Glasgow, they have chosen wrestling, using the bodies of pro wrestlers Molly Spartan and Jake Lawless to create the living sculpture. Audiences will watch as the pair are carefully tied and hauled up, then slowly brought back down and undone. Coming from dance and performance backgrounds, the artists are invested in endurance and what the body is capable of. “We’re working with degrees of discomfort and endurance,” George says of the physical demands on the participants, “but it’s not sitting in pain for an hour.” Bondage drags with it certain assumptions about violence and dominance, yet both shibari and wrestling delicately navigate care, consent and power. “It’s about trust and communication, about listening to each other and watching for cues,” George says. They’ve been surprised by the similarities between the art forms, with each relying on watchful adjustments throughout. “Wrestlers have ways to communicate when there’s a certain narrative arc they’re trying to achieve,” Kok says, “so they’re looking out for each other even while they’re fighting.” Wider popularity for wrestling may come in waves, but for the truly dedicated, commitment is unrelenting. Months are spent organising getting the Clash of the Comics comedians to wrestling school. The Fist Club fighters train multiple times a week, with Still Lives capturing this devotion by stretching out the patient endurance of preparation. Through their chosen styles, these artists want to celebrate the sport, welcome new supporters and show that wrestling doesn’t belong to a single gender, shape or style. “There’s so much happening live,” says Bandenberg, “done by people who love it. They’re not getting rich off it, they’re just seeing it as a creative art form that brings joy.” Clash of the Comics is at Hammersmith Apollo, London, 8 October; Fist Club is at Colour Factory, London, 11 October, and Lost Horizon, Bristol, 8 November; Still Lives is part of Take Me Somewhere, Tramway, Glasgow, 25 October.",

    "article_text": "Going out: Cinema One Battle After Another Out now Clocking in at nearly three hours, this loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland from director Paul Thomas Anderson (Phantom Thread, There Will Be Blood) stars Leonardo DiCaprio, and sees a former revolutionary on a quest to rescue his daughter from the hands of an old enemy. Ellis Park Out now Musician and composer Warren Ellis is known for his collaborations with Nick Cave in bands and on film scores, but this film, the first documentary from film-maker Justin Kurzel (Snowtown, Nitram) focuses on a Cave-free passion project: a wildlife sanctuary in the forests of Sumatra co-founded by Ellis. Visions of Ukraine Barbican, London, 29 September to 2 October Ranging from the silent cinema era to modern movie-making, this short season at the Barbican of Ukrainian film includes Mikhail Kaufman’s In Spring (1929), and the UK premiere of new archival documentary Fragments of Ice (2024), as well as short films dedicated to the Ukrainian queer community during the current war. The Strangers: Chapter 2 Out now Don’t be fooled by “Chapter 2” – this is in fact the fourth film in the Strangers home-invasion horror franchise, which claims to be based on a true story but, erm, isn’t – unless “some murders happen in a house” is close enough. Renny Harlin (Deep Blue Sea) directs the stabbing and slashing. Catherine Bray * * * Going out: Gigs Flo 28 September to 2 October; tour starts London British R&amp;B girl band Flo tour in support of last year’s buttery soft debut LP Access All Areas. They’ve been in the studio since – check out recent Kaytranada collaboration The Mood – so expect new songs, too. Michael Cragg Polish jazz festival London Kings Place, London, 27 September; Pizza Express Jazz Soho, London, 28 September The ever-innovative Polish jazz scene’s 2025 festival London festival showcases both established and rising stars. Trumpet virtuoso Piotr Wojtasik with vocalist-pianist Anna Maria Jopek (27 September), and UK-based vocalist-violinist Alice Zawadzki and singer Aga Zaryan (28 September; the latter the first Polish artist to record for Blue Note), are among the highlights. John Fordham Celebrating Shostakovich Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, 3 October The BBC National Orchestra of Wales marks the 50th anniversary of the death of Shostakovich with a performance of his most massive symphony, No 7 in C, the Leningrad. Ryan Bancroft conducts, and prefaces it with Shostakovich’s first violin concerto. Andrew Clements The Magnetic Fields 26 September to 6 October; tour starts Bristol Released in 1999, the Magnetic Fields’ sixth album 69 Love Songs has rightly taken up classic status. Packed full of pin-sharp vignettes couched in country, synthpop, folk and jazz, it will be played in full across two nights, in three cities. MC * * * Going out: Art Howard Hodgkin Pitzhanger Manor &amp; Gallery, London, 1 October to 8 March This artist of memory made prints that are almost as lush as his paintings. Hodgkin’s works on paper get a lavish showing here, in an exhibition that is also a chance to ponder his legacy. Intimate and evocative, private yet highly accessible, he was one of Britain’s few great abstractionists. Turner prize 2025 Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, Bradford, 27 September to 22 February Is the Turner prize still relevant? Can it start national conversations? Head for Bradford, this year’s UK city of culture, to find out as the shortlisted artists strut their stuff. Photographer Rene Matić and painter Mohammed Sami stand out for their striking work. Zadie Xa and Nnena Kalu also compete. Marie Antoinette Style V&amp;A South Kensington, London, to 22 March The French queen whose life ended brutally is revived here as a style icon. Echoes of the ancien régime’s rococo fashions in modern pop culture are juxtaposed with 18th-century paintings and objects in a show that brings together the historical and contemporary – or does it trivialise a tragic past? Yuki Kihara Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, 3 October to 1 March Two white male icons are deconstructed in a show that combines Paradise Camp, an installation inspired by Gauguin’s paintings of Tahiti, with a video entitled Darwin Drag. Gauguin’s images of the Pacific are mocked and reclaimed by this queer, indigenous artist who also gives the theory of evolution a twist. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage Stevie Martin 2 October to 6 December; tour starts Manchester For the modern standup, in-person performance is only half the job – making popular social media content is now non-negotiable. In Clout, Martin, who pivoted from live sketch to viral videos in lockdown, (she has since appeared on Taskmaster and in Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping) – entertainingly deconstructs the demands of online and IRL comedy. Rachel Aroesti Bacchae National Theatre: Olivier, London, to 1 November Heartstopper actor Nima Taleghani’s very first play premieres on the Olivier stage. It’s a modern take on Euripides’s The Bacchae, infused with spoken word, music and dance and helmed by the National’s new director Indhu Rubasingham. Miriam Gillinson Syncopated Liverpool Playhouse, to 4 October The real-life story of an African American jazz band who toured the UK in 1919, set against the Liverpool docks and rippling with memories and music. From leading Black British theatre company Talawa and Liverpool Everyman &amp; Playhouse. MG Dance Umbrella Various venues, London, and online, 2 to 31 October The annual contemporary dance fest makes a point of presenting artists from around the world who aren’t well known (yet) to UK audiences. This year there’s cutting-edge performance from Colombia, Sweden, Senegal and more. You can also buy a digital pass to watch a specially selected programme of dance films online. Lyndsey Winship * * * Staying in: Streaming How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge) BBC One &amp; iPlayer, 3 October, 9.30pm An appearance from Norfolk’s finest is always a gift from the comedy gods, but this new series, in which Alan addresses the nation’s mental health, crisis feels especially promising. Steve Coogan returns to satirise yet another era of British telly. Chad Powers Disney+, Tuesday This new series isn’t quite the direction you’d expect an ascending Hollywood leading man to go in, but Glen Powell proves he doesn’t take himself remotely seriously with an Adam Sandler-esque comedy about a disgraced college quarterback who dons prosthetics in the hope of scoring a second chance at American football stardom. Taylor Channel 4, 30 September, 9.15pm She’s the biggest pop star on the planet, but Taylor Swift is yet to get the rigorous, academic-adjacent documentary treatment. This new series is here to change that: directed by Guy King (Our Falklands War), it enlists cultural commentators, industry insiders and fans to discuss a career that has transformed the music business. Blue Lights BBC One &amp; iPlayer, 29 September, 9pm The excellent Northern Irish cop drama moves beyond the mean streets of Belfast and into a more superficially middle-class milieu for its third series – but our officers are in as much mortal danger as ever. Siân Brooke and Martin McCann return, with Michael Smiley joining the cast as intelligence officer Colly. RA * * * Staying in: Games Ghost of Yōtei PlayStation 5; out 2 October The hugely anticipated follow-up to 2020’s open-world samurai epic is set more than 300 years after the original. You play a wandering, and extremely cross, mercenary who enacts painful vengeance upon the outlaws who left you for dead. Train Sim World 6 PC, PlayStation, XBox; out 30 September Or for something completely different, bask in the magnificence of some of the planet’s most Instagrammable choo-choos as you pilot them along routes both famous and pretty. If you’re wondering: “Does does that include the Riviera route between Exeter and Paignton?”, you can relax – it does. Luke Holland * * * Staying in: Albums Mariah Carey – Here for It All Out now Keen to prove she doesn’t just emerge from hibernation for Christmas, Mariah Carey releases her 16th album, and first in seven years. Home to the Eric B &amp; Rakim-sampling throwback Type Dangerous and the dancehall-tinged Sugar Sweet, the album features assists from Kehlani and Anderson .Paak. Olivia Dean – The Art of Loving Out now A song on the recent Bridget Jones soundtrack, a Sam Fender support, and a handful of excellent soul-pop bops have shifted the London singer-songwriter into the big leagues. This second album is already home to two Top 10 singles, while next year’s arena tour is basically sold out. Geese - Getting Killed Out now This follow-up to the New York noise merchants’ 2023 opus 3D Country arrives in the wake of frontman Cameron Winter’s critically adored 2024 solo album, Heavy Metal. Back to his day job, Winter’s penetrating growl rips through the jazz-meets-post-rock Trinidad, before smoothing out on plucky lead single Taxes. Zara Larsson – Midnight Sun Out now On her fifth album, Swedish pop star Larsson bottles her sun-kissed emotional exuberance into a tight 30 minutes. The title track is a Jersey Club banger by way of Scandinavia, the rowdy, chant-heavy Pretty Ugly is a glorious headache, while Crush fuses EDM with lustful lyrics. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food States of Independence Podcast Music journalist Rob Fitzpatrick’s series about the history of influential independent music labels begins with a deep dive into Beggars Banquet. He traces its development from platforming punks to signing Gary Numan and building an indie empire. Lost in Time YouTube Mixing remastered archival footage with lively explainers, Lost in Time’s videos deliver engaging insights into the past, from turn-of-the-20th-century colourised cityscapes of New York and London to analysis of the Roman empire’s technological developments. Death in Dubai BBC Sounds, out now Journalist Runako Celina’s two-year investigation into the death of Ugandan 23-year-old Mona Kizz explores not only the circumstances surrounding her fall from a Dubai tower block but the double standards of the city’s high society.

    "article_text": "A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. “Because of those posts, I lost my job. Today, after nearly seven years, the court of appeal has finally put that right. Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Sean Jones KC, acting for Farmor’s, said in earlier written submissions that Higgs was not dismissed for manifesting her beliefs “but because the manner in which it was manifested could reasonably have caused and did cause others to think she was expressing homophobic or transphobic views”. He argued remitting the case was appropriate as “fuller reasons” for the decision were needed. In a 57-page ruling, Underhill said Higgs’s posts were not grossly offensive but a series of derogatory sneers. “I do not believe that dismissal was even arguably a proportionate sanction for the claimant’s conduct,” he added. A spokesperson for Stonewall said: “Today’s court of appeal ruling is a judgment on the proportionality of her dismissal, not an endorsement of the beliefs she expressed. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” The Press Association contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "Black scholarship in the UK risks being wiped out due to redundancies and course closures, leading academics have warned. Universities in England are engulfed in a financial crisis and have in response implemented a number of cost-cutting measures. But prominent academics and students are raising the alarm that these cuts are falling on lecturers and courses that played a leading role in addressing racial disparities in higher education. The University of Chichester made Prof Hakim Adi redundant and cut his MRes on the history of Africa and the African diaspora. Prof Robert Beckford, the well-known theologian who researched climate and social justice, has been made redundant at the University of Winchester, and Birmingham City University (BCU) shuttered its black studies undergraduate course. While Goldsmiths, University of London reversed plans to cut its Black British literature MA, stating it would commit to running the course for another two years after an outcry, it recently made the founder and convener of the course, Prof Deirdre Obsorne, redundant. Kadija George Sesay, who was one of several writers to sign an open letter criticising the move, told the Guardian that she had returned her honorary fellowship to Goldsmiths. In the past decade, there were notable advances in the creation of dedicated lectureships, and broader curriculum development in black history, culture, politics and philosophy in higher education. This, as well as active mentoring and recruitment of academics of colour, led to improvements in the number of black professors in the UK. But universities say they are in the midst of a dire financial crisis and these courses, while expensive to run, are not as popular as they are in the US, where the discipline of black history and arts is more established. Campaigners say the courses and the lecturers’ specialist knowledge should be ringfenced and require time and development to have an impact. Even with recent improvements, fewer than 1% of professors are black. Beckford said: “The reality is I’ve never been in a job since 1993 which has been secure. I’ve always had the threat of redundancy because there was always a lack of funding for posts that were connected to race. I’ve never had that kind of luxury of knowing that I was in a place that was going to invest in me and give me lots of time to develop my craft.” Beckford, who alone supported 16 black PhD students, added: “You get a freeze on the development and mentoring by jettisoning people like me. My work has always been fundamentally about empowering black students, empowering black colleagues.” While the University of Winchester said it would not comment on individual cases, a spokesperson noted that “all the redundancies upon which we have consulted reflect the challenging financial circumstances facing the university sector”. Prof Kehinde Andrews, who leads Birmingham City University’s black studies department, said he was disappointed but not surprised when he was told the undergraduate course would be cut. “There’s no appreciation for the importance of black intellectual thought, so they get rid of it really easily. I think that’s what you’re seeing everywhere. “You can’t even call it erasure because there’s so little black production in Britain. It’ll be completely wiped out, there’ll be nothing left.” BCU declined to comment. Adi believes these cuts will have a dire impact on the number of black history professors in the UK. The masters course he oversaw produced seven students who went on to undertake studies at PhD level, six of them at Chichester. “We were particularly trying to redress the imbalance in higher education: the fact that there were so few students of African and Caribbean heritage studying history at postgraduate level in this country,” he said. The students on Adi’s course have launched a legal challenge against the university, alleging discrimination and breach of contract after it terminated the programme while they were part way through their studies. A spokesperson for the University of Chichester said while it had made the “difficult decision” to suspend a number of courses, current masters students “were encouraged to complete their studies with us and were offered appropriate tuition”. Osborne was heartbroken when her redundancy was confirmed earlier this month. “What kind of message does removing opportunities for access to that knowledge send to students and future generations of black creatives?” Dr Stephen Graham, Goldsmiths’ executive dean of faculty, said the MA programme provided a crucial platform for black scholarship and increased diversity within the academic community. “These were the reasons both behind the creation of the MA programme and our persistence in supporting it in the face of low recruitment numbers,” he said. He added he was aware of the concerns about the impact on black scholarship of the financial challenges universities face. A student on the Black British literature programme, who did not wish to be named, said: “I joined the course because of the professor, who is a leading academic in the space. I absolutely trusted her experience, vision and commitment – that has now been taken away. “New students have arrived from overseas who spoke to the professor, made a significant financial and personal commitment, and that professor is simply not there.” Graham said: “The course is being taught by two leading black scholars and over the next two years we will work to develop a more multidisciplinary programme that will help in attracting more students.”",

    "article_text": "I have a friend who rejects the notion of “guilty pleasures”. There is, she argues, plenty of real and justified guilt in the world, without co-opting it to our choice of trash TV or an unkickable penchant for romantasy novels. She’s a helpful touchstone when I hear myself trying to justify the silly superhero film I went to see at the cinema on the basis that it might have carried an underlying anti-fascist message (if you squinted hard enough at the screen). My friend will sigh kindly and then remind me: sometimes it’s OK just to enjoy things. It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer. Ask a football fan if they enjoyed themselves at the match they just paid a decent whack to see, and there’s a better-than-even chance they will tell you no. If it was a close match, they will have been too anxious to have fun; if they lost they will be mourning their defeat. Even if their own side ran rampant, you can find them complaining about the lack of challenge or jeopardy. We are, as fans, especially averse to one-sided games, which can feel anything from a deflationary disappointment to a waste of everybody’s time. This is why the current Women’s Rugby World Cup is such a curious phenomenon. The tournament has been one of largely lopsided scorelines, from the group stages to the quarter-finals. Only five of the 28 fixtures have been decided by fewer than 14 points, and more than half were won by more than 40 – at least six scores. And yet there remains a profound and unanimous pleasure to be had across the entire affair: it’s hard to find anyone that’s watching along and not enjoying it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). Meanwhile the action on the pitch has delivered flair and fascination, even on days when the rain has lashed down until the ball is butter and the scrums steam like suet pudding. The match-ups may be uneven but the power and athleticism on display on all sides of the pitch have been mesmerising. Sure, the host nation’s dominance is a natural mood enhancer. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. That’s only part of the picture, however. It doesn’t encompass the joyful embrace of The Kid, New Zealand’s 18-year-old top try-scorer Braxton Sorensen-McGee (whose daring dashes down the wing could well knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles if the two sides meet). It can’t account for the bipartisan cheer when Spain, 54-3 down against those same Black Ferns, scored an 83rd-minute try. More than a year ago, industry insiders involved in women’s sport were predicting the captivating success of this World Cup, arriving on the back of a Lionesses campaign and in the wake of Ilona Maher’s single-handed social media takeover of rugby union. More than one said privately that 2025 would be the year rugby “flipped” and a women’s event outperformed the Lions tour. The men certainly delivered intense drama and historic scenes as Maro Itoje led the Lions to victory in the second Test. But they didn’t do it to a TV audience of 4.6m. And no one in the team was wearing a cowboy hat or banging on drums from the stands. It’s that quirky, come-as-you-are quality that is this current tournament’s greatest triumph. Even as it has taken its slickly commercialised place in a crammed calendar of global sporting events, this Rugby World Cup still seems fuelled by a radiant and irrepressible delight. Plenty of stadiums work hard to create a party atmosphere but you don’t get the sense that anyone here is forcing or faking it. Not when players are taking up their positions before kick-off still lip-syncing to the music on the PA. Other sports – and more pertinently their investors – will be analysing this fan engagement and wondering how to replicate it. Good luck to them. The core of rugby union’s appeal is its eclecticism and the personalities that beam from the women’s game are one-of-a-kind. There’s the South African No 8 Aseza Hele, nicknamed flower or “Blommie” off the pitch for her sweet nature, who struggles even to recognise herself when she’s sandbagging the opposition. There’s Abby Dow, the lethal finisher who you’ll find neatly crocheting referees’ whistles in the dugout. This is a sporting sorority that confounds and confuses boringly predictable stereotypes of how a woman looks and behaves – Anne-Marie’s song choice of Psycho at the climax of the opening ceremony could not have been better chosen – while simultaneously wreathing itself in Barbie pink, 90s girl-power nostalgia, make-up tie-ins. There’s a freedom in the way this tournament has joyfully embraced it all and cared not one brass farthing for your opinion. And who would dare to mess with this powerful pack? The Red Roses’ adopted slogan is “for the girls”. It is, of course, a marketing tactic as much as a rallying cry, but it came directly from team conversations and reflects something quite true about the women’s rugby community, that is a place where people are for each other, not against them. Their fast-growing fanbase, many of whom have only discovered the sport in the past couple of years, do not show up to games with the typical baggage: decades of disappointment, crusted-over anger, inherited and inexplicably toxic rivalries. They have found their way to this sport along far less tribal pathways, through body-positive TikTok videos and Ellie Kildunne’s haircare tips. There has been no male gatekeeping here, no trivia questions to establish whether you really belong: everyone is instantly welcome. It may be this is all just a function of where the sport is at developmentally. Growth will, of course, bring change, just as it has for women’s football. Perhaps the gleaming sense of fun will tarnish with time and corporate takeover, and perhaps not. For now, it’s OK to just enjoy things.",

    "article_text": "When the dust finally settles in the days after Sunday’s eagerly awaited US Open men’s final, the United States Tennis Association will issue its annual victory-lap press release. It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity and turning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination. But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician – any politician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval. According to internal emails obtained by outlets including PA and Bounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.) This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protester gluing himself to a seat for nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind its US Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation. And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy. Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa May was booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macron was whistled during the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is all but guaranteed a chorus of boos during public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next to the venom reserved for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman from fans. And Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have been given hostile receptions by sports crowds. Somehow the United Kingdom, France and the United States survived those incidents intact. That the USTA thinks Trump must be insulated from reality hints at something darker. It is reminiscent of regimes where the leader’s image must be protected from public ridicule. It shows how much Trump’s first term – and his bullying of cultural institutions – still shapes behavior. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. Now, as Tom Dart wrote before this year’s Super Bowl, he is increasingly accommodated or treated with silence. The Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered, vibrant and exuberantly multicultural, where the crowd is as much a presence as the players on the court. By sanitizing its reaction, the USTA isn’t just shielding Trump. It is stripping the event of its unique character, authenticity and integrity. That irony cuts even deeper because the Open has always been at the forefront of progress. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. It platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion. From a Maga vantage point, of course, it probably looks like the Woke Super Bowl: King’s name on the gates, Gibson’s silhouette over Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus Williams lionized, rainbow-tinged Pride nights, and a governing body trumpeting diversity at every turn. Which, if we’re being honest, may be one reason Trump is showing up in the first place: a 4D chess move with the intent of turning a tennis match into another battleground of grievance. Getting booed by thousands of fans drinking $23 vodka-lemonades won’t exactly be a bad look for his base, especially in a corrupt, disgusting hellhole like New York. Fans will still do what fans do. If they want to boo, they will boo. But millions at home may never see it, thanks to a governing body that has chosen to act less like a guardian of sport and more like a nervous producer of campaign stagecraft. For a sport that prides itself on honesty and clarity – the ball is in or out – it is a shameful retreat.",

    "article_text": "‘They called it an experiment aimed at younger audiences’ Mateusz Demski, 31, journalist, Kraków, Poland I’ve been a freelance journalist for 10 years, usually writing for magazines and websites about cinema. I presented a morning show on Radio Kraków twice a week for about two years. It was only one part of my work, but I really enjoyed it. It was about culture and cinema, and featured a range of people, from artists to activists. I remember interviewing Ukrainians about the Russian invasion for the first programme I presented, back in 2022. I was let go in August 2024, alongside a dozen co-workers who were also part-time. We were told the radio station was having financial problems. I was relatively OK with it, as I had other income streams. But a few months later I heard that Radio Kraków was launching programmes hosted by three AI characters. Each had AI-generated photographs, a biography and a specific personality. They called it an “experiment” aimed at younger audiences. One of the first shows they did was a live “interview” with Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, winner of the 1996 Nobel prize for literature, who had died 12 years earlier. What are the ethics of using the likeness of a dead person? Szymborska is a symbol of Polish intellectual culture, so it caused outrage. I couldn’t understand it: radio is created by people for other people. We cannot replace our experiences, emotions or voices with avatars. One of my colleagues who was laid off is queer. One of the new AI avatars was called Alex, a non-binary student and a “specialist” in queer subjects. In Poland, we are still fighting for queer rights, and as journalists it’s incumbent on us to have real representation when reporting on this. For my colleague and the LGBTQ+ community, it was shocking and damaging to hear their lived experience and knowledge being imitated by AI. Some of us who had been laid off started a petition against the station, calling for regulation and to get the AI shows taken off air. We got tens of thousands of people to sign – actors, journalists, artists, but also listeners. Hundreds of young people didn’t want to listen to an AI show. The station has since scrapped the avatars, largely because of the success of our campaign. It’s now student-run. The station claim this is about offering mentorship, but it’s also a cheaper alternative to hiring qualified journalists. I guess it’s better than AI, though. There are still no clear regulations covering its use in Poland. I’m not campaigning for regulation because I lost my job to AI: I’m campaigning because I’m worried about the ethics of all of this; about misinformation and deceiving listeners.I’m a realist – I’m not completely against AI. I think it can be used responsibly to do the boring bits of our job. But we can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence. * * * ‘Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced’ Lina Meilina, 30, illustrator, Bandung, Indonesia I’ve been drawing and painting since I was a kid. Even in kindergarten, I was doodling. By elementary school I was drawing comics and my teachers knew I had potential. I have strict, traditional parents who told me art wouldn’t make me any money, but I wanted to follow my dreams. Now I make anime-style illustrations, and most of my income comes from commissions: I draw bespoke characters for clients, and also create my own. Even before AI tools arrived, it wasn’t easy. Indonesia doesn’t take artists seriously and copyright laws are weak. I’ve seen people steal my work and put it on merch to sell on retail websites such as AliExpress. I have to get them taken down myself, screenshotting pages one by one to report them to the site’s admin. Now, AI makes it harder to prove ownership, because it can take your art and make slight changes, so it’s not a direct copy. I first learned about generative AI a few years ago, watching a YouTuber introduce viewers to the software Midjourney, which generates images based on prompts. He asked the program to produce an image in the style of comic book artist Alex Ross. The finished work was good, with Ross’s distinctive hyper-realistic style and colour palette. I remember thinking, “Oh shit, this is going to be a disaster.” Since last year, when AI really took off, my workload has plummeted. I used to get up to 15 commissions a month; now I get around five. People can take your art and feed it into an AI program to create work. A follower of mine recently used AI to portray my characters doing something inappropriate. I tried to report it, but the platform said it didn’t violate its copyright policy. One of the main platforms freelance artists use to get work recently launched a campaign called “Nobody cares if you use AI”, encouraging clients and artists to embrace AI tools. Well, I care, as do a lot of my colleagues. Even the Indonesian government is using AI art: they recently released a video promoting a scheme that provides free lunches for students. It’s a great initiative, but it breaks my heart that they used AI instead of commissioning a talented Indonesian artist. I used to work in a small studio as a storyboard artist for TV commercials. Since AI appeared, I’ve seen colleagues lose jobs because companies are using Midjourney. Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced – and pay in south-east Asia is already low. Maybe my mum was right that I shouldn’t be an artist. I’ve had to look for other sources of income – at the moment, I make cosplay props on commission. I love illustrating, but if I keep losing clients because of AI, I’ll probably go into prop-making full-time. * * * ‘I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs’ Annabel Beales, 49, copywriter, Southampton, UK I landed my dream job in 2023, writing content for a garden centre. I mostly did search engine optimisation, and wrote gardening tips for their magazine and blog. My colleagues were friendly and the hours were flexible. I’ve always loved reading and writing. I was brought up on a farm with no television, so I was always at the library, reading Judy Blume books. If I didn’t like the ending, I would rewrite it. But I never thought then that I could pursue writing as a career: where I’m from, it was hard to break into anything creative – people either worked as nurses or at the local car manufacturer. Even though I wanted to be a writer, my mum had always told me to have a back-up plan. Copywriting didn’t come to me straight away, so I did secretarial work for years, and admin roles in the public sector. I’d heard of some friends who needed a copywriter for their businesses, and I was interested in writing professionally, so I enrolled on an online course. It cost a month’s wages and took eight months to complete, but I enjoyed the creativity. I got the gardening centre job a few months later. I’d interview different experts to write blogs on topics such as growing potatoes or planting trees. I threw myself into it and passed my probation. Around eight months in, I noticed I was getting less work. One day, I overheard my boss saying to a colleague, “Just put it in ChatGPT.” The marketing department started to use it more often to write their blogs, and they were just asking me to proofread. I remember walking around the company’s beautiful gardens with my manager and asking him if AI would replace me, and he stressed that my job was safe. Six weeks later, I was called to a meeting with HR. They told me they were letting me go immediately. It was just before Christmas. Thankfully, I got a temp role doing admin work in January, but going back to that after having my dream writing job was devastating. The company’s website is sad to see now. It’s all AI-generated and factual – there’s no substance, or sense of actually enjoying gardening. AI scares the hell out of me. I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs. I’m now a PA in cancer research in the university sector. I feel more settled, but I regret going into copywriting. I got the job at the gardening centre at a time when my mum was terminally ill. I remember asking her whether I should take it, as it would mean I wouldn’t be able to spend as much time with her. She told me to follow my dreams and go for it. I thought I’d be there for years, working as a copywriter until I retired. Looking back, I wish I had spent more time with my mum instead. * * * ‘Listening to a series I’d recorded, I heard my character say a line – but it wasn’t my voice’ Richie Tavake, 31, voice actor, San Francisco, US I’ve spent 10 years training to be a voice actor. It takes skill – it’s my job to bring honesty to the story I tell. I recently played the main character, Jessie, in a survival video game. Jessie crash-lands on a snowy mountain – as his voice, I have to consider whether he’s injured, how he feels and the shock he’s in. My mum encouraged me to try acting classes while I was at university, as it was something I had always talked about doing. Immediately, I was hooked, and after a few semesters I decided to pursue it professionally. I started training seriously while taking customer service jobs to support myself. My first gig in a professional studio was an Animal Farm audio drama in 2023, in which I played Napoleon. It was a great experience to get mic’d up and perform with a whole cast. The effect of generative AI in my industry is something I’ve felt personally. Recently, I was listening to an audio drama series I’d recorded and heard my character say a line, but it wasn’t my voice. I hadn’t recorded that section. I contacted the producer, who told me he had input my voice into AI software to say the extra line. But he hadn’t asked my permission. I later found out he had uploaded my voice to a platform, allowing other producers to access it. I requested its removal, but it took me a week, and I had to speak to five people to get it done. The Screen Actors Guild, SAG-AFTRA, began a strike last year against certain major video games studios because voice actors were unhappy with the lack of protections against AI. Developers can record actors, then AI can use those initial chunks of audio to generate further recordings. Actors don’t get paid for any of the extra AI-generated stuff, and they lose their jobs. I’ve seen it happen. One client told me straight out that they have started using generative AI for their voices because it’s faster. But when characters are written and voiced well, people relate to them. Take Batman, who was voiced by the late Kevin Conroy in the animated series. People appreciated his work because he brought the character to life. When done right, people will value it and pay money for it. There is also the issue of diversity. I’m American-Samoan and I wouldn’t be happy to hear a Samoan voice generated by AI – it could be inaccurate and even offensive. It’s just a bunch of numbers and words imitating a culture I was brought up in. A great example of this is Ghost of Tsushima, a video game that’s based in Japan. All the cast were of Japanese heritage: they were in tune with the culture and they brought so much honesty to the story. AI can’t replicate that. It’s a machine; it doesn’t have that background and it never will. * * * ‘I never anticipated they’d get rid of me’ Jadun Sykes, 28, graphic designer, Wakefield, UK As a kid I was always arty – sketching, making Play-Doh sculptures. I studied game design and art at college, and went down an Adobe Photoshop rabbit hole. It was fun and I was good at it, so I decided to turn it into a career, starting at the company when I was 21. They sell a platform that creates landing pages and email layouts. I’d design the templates and do bespoke work for clients. When generative AI came along, the company was very vocal about using it as a tool to help clients get creative. As a company that sells digital automation, developments in AI fit them well. I knew they were introducing it to do things like writing emails and generating images, but I never anticipated they’d get rid of me: I’d been there six years and was their only graphic designer. My redundancy came totally out of the blue. One day, HR told me my role was no longer required as much of my work was being replaced by AI. I made a YouTube video about my experience. It went viral and I received hundreds of responses from graphic designers in the same boat, which made me realise I’m not the only victim – it’s happening globally, and it takes a huge mental toll. I went to college, I studied, I did six years of work. Was it all for nothing? After I was let go, I spent months looking for a job. I didn’t find work in graphic design, but did get a job as a content creator at a PC manufacturer. I make videos of the production line, interview staff members and do some social media. I’m not worried here: my employers don’t agree with replacing human roles with AI. I may use it to edit pictures but only to enhance something a human created – say, to remove cables in the back of a product image. We would never post an image entirely generated by AI, which is what my old company is doing. My advice to every graphic designer is to learn as many skills as possible. You have to be prepared.",

    "article_text": "The bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher by the sculptor Douglas Jennings has a rating of 2.8 out of five on Google Maps. Although curiously, none of the reviewers seems to have overly preoccupied themselves with the quality of the craftsmanship or the fidelity of the likeness. “One of the most important PMs this country ever had,” writes one. “It’s a public toilet but there’s nowhere to wash your hands,” writes another. The statue was originally commissioned more than a decade ago, and was intended to stand in front of the Houses of Parliament, but Westminster city council rejected it on the grounds that it might become a target for vandalism. Instead, it was offered to her birthplace of Grantham, a town she left at the age of 18 and rarely visited again. Within hours of its installation, someone threw an egg at it. Shortly after that, it was defaced with red paint. And now, on a grey October afternoon, Margaret Thatcher herself is gazing upon it, bearing a look of pure disgust. “They’ve got the date wrong,” she moans, her trademark handbag sliding down a blue-sleeved arm pointed accusingly upwards. “It says I died in 2013. As you can see, I am very much alive.” The presence of Thatcher in her home town, on what would have been her 100th birthday, has drawn a small crowd outside the town’s Guildhall Arts Centre. Motorists toot horns; fans want selfies; passersby occasionally flick V-signs from across the street. A middle-aged woman approaches and clasps Thatcher’s hands in her own. “I just want to say, if it weren’t for you, I would never have been able to buy my house.” “That’s wonderful,” Thatcher replies. “And are you still living in the house?” “No,” the woman says. “I sold it to my son.” Somehow it scarcely matters that the figure they are venerating and vilifying is not Thatcher at all, but an actor named Matt Tedford, who plays the former prime minister in a riotous drag show called Margaret Thatcher: Queen of Soho, which played at the Guildhall on Monday night. In the show, Britain’s first female prime minister is depicted walking the streets of London on the night before the section 28 vote in parliament in 1987, stumbling upon a gay bar and ultimately reinventing herself as a disco diva. It’s sharp, topical, ridiculous and very funny. Tedford has been portraying Thatcher for 12 years – “longer than she was prime minister”, he observes wryly. The role has taken him to some strange and random places. He’s met party leaders. He’s been for dinner at the Foreign Office. He’s shared a stage with Kemi Badenoch at a book launch. For a character that began life as a gaudy Halloween costume around the start of the last decade, it’s been quite a ride. As he puts it: “I always say I’m the only northerner she ever gave work to.” Now his work has brought him to Thatcher Fest: a clever wheeze cooked up by Grantham’s local councillors to commemorate the centenary of its most famous daughter. There are talks and walks, Thatcher-themed music nights and exhibitions of memorabilia, Gyles Brandreth giving a lecture on Thatcher’s unlikely connection to Winnie-the-Pooh, exhibitions of her exercise books at the local school and newspaper clippings at the library. It’s attracted all sorts: Queen of Soho was uproariously received by a largely progressive crowd, while the true-blue diehards packed out the Guildhall for a talk by Edwina Currie, asking reliably bone-headed questions about what Thatcher would have made of “today’s political correctness”. Not everything has been a riotous success: one of the walking tours at the weekend attracted just five people. But for a small town known to most as a stop on the East Coast Main Line, it is the spotlight they crave. “Grantham has never had as much publicity as it has this week,” boasts Ashley Baxter, the independent leader of the local South Kesteven district council. “Having Queen of Soho upset the Conservatives. Having a Thatcher Fest at all upset the left. We’re upsetting all the right people. Which is only right, because people are still … very emotional about her.” On a wider level, the anniversary has been marked with the usual spume of reassessment, revisionism, tie-in content and outright silliness. The phrase “whatever you thought of her politics” has been flogged to within an inch of its life. At the recent Tory conference in Manchester, their former leader was a weirdly pervasive, almost phantasmagorical presence in the hall: cardboard cutouts, a photo mosaic, an AI Thatcher, her outfits displayed in a glass case. There has been a new book alleging that she had two extramarital affairs, a birthday gala dinner in London, an Unherd article on Thatcher’s “erotic power” that describes her as “a nursery dominatrix, thrashing grown-up little boys who confuse punishment with love”. More than three decades after she left politics, it seems there are still plenty desperate to reanimate her by incantation. And there is a certain irony here, for during her time Thatcher was largely uninterested in furnishing the iconography or cult of personality that grew around her: a life, as her biographer Charles Moore observed, “unexamined by the person who lived it”. She was unmoved by questions of legacy, never kept a diary, threw away huge piles of her documents. She wanted to be consequential. But she was never overly fussed about her place in history. And so what remains of Thatcher today is essentially a palimpsest; a dirty print of projected feelings and half-remembered catchphrases, slavish adoration and bogeyman hatred. This is doubly true for subsequent generations with no actual memories of her. “You meet lots of young people who think they should hate Thatcher, but don’t necessarily know who she was, what effect she had on their lives,” says Tedford. “They know she closed the mines. They know about the milk. There’s a remove there, where we’ve been able to appraise her differently to a generation who grew up with her as a present-tense villain.” Naturally enough, current politics also intrude here, as Thatcher’s old party stands on the brink of collapse, as traditional institutions lie in ruins, as a surging far right evoke her memory while simultaneously running from her libertarian brand of small-state economics. And of course it is only natural to wonder what she would have made of the rise of Reform and open blood-and-soil nativism, the St George’s flags brandished forebodingly from the upstairs windows of Grantham’s narrow terraced houses. Is this what she wanted? Is the new far right a continuation of Thatcherism, or a reaction against it? “Thatcher remains part of Grantham’s story, and rightly so,” says Ben Green, a Reform councillor who defected from the Conservatives this summer, in an email. “But the challenges we face today are very different from those of the 1980s. Her reforms revived enterprise but left too many industrial towns behind. In my view, the country now needs a more patriotic and muscular state: pro-enterprise, yes. But also pro-community.” Moore doesn’t, on a point of principle, answer hypotheticals about what Thatcher might have done or believed today. But there are elements of Reform’s current appeal that, he suggests, did not chime with hers. “She was not interested in racial stuff at all,” he says. “And of course she was completely against repatriation, which she thought was inhumane, and also sort of nonsensical.” Back in Grantham, Currie has just finished giving a talk on Thatcher and feminism to an audience of enraptured diehards and a few dozen extremely bored-looking schoolchildren on a field trip. Baxter, the council leader, is in his office reflecting on Thatcher’s true legacy in the town. And for all its gilded heritage, this is a place with largely familiar issues: closing shops, a shortage of housing, a shrunken civic life, a basic absence of identity. “My colleagues will walk down the London Road and say: ‘Oh, that used to be a machining place. That used to be a factory. That was where so many people worked.’ But this is the story of the UK. “Then on the high street, you’ll see we’ve got our fair share of empty shops,” Baxter continues. “We’re trying to put works of art into them. And because of Thatcher, and the subsequent austerity governments, you’re only allowed art by stealth. If I said tomorrow we needed an arts officer on a salary of £30,000, the answer would – correctly – be that we haven’t got any money. Same with leisure. I’m in this job because the Tories shut down my local leisure centre in 2021 and we’re trying to find a way to reopen it.” Perhaps the most generous view of Thatcher is that she was a prime minister with no real concept of the long-term consequences of her actions. Perhaps she genuinely did believe that her wave of liberalisations would secure the greatest comfort for the greatest number, a little patriotic paradise in which everyone would own their own house and a little nest egg in British Telecom shares. Perhaps she failed to properly anticipate the storm of globalisation, the way it ripped the soul out of communities and created a staggering concentration of wealth among a very few. Perhaps you might even argue that, given the prevailing global currents of the 1980s, if it wasn’t Thatcher, it would have been someone else. But, of course, it was Thatcher, a naturally combative politician who saw ideological enemies at every turn, urgent and angry and unafraid of disruption. And perhaps the real legacy of her time is the death of the principle that we could all somehow prosper together. More than any other figure in our lifetime, Thatcher embedded the idea that our own circumstances can only ever be improved at the expense of someone else, by picking the right side and fighting for eternity, the politics of envy and cruelty and vindictiveness baked into our electoral calculus. You will be fine, because others will not. Perhaps this is why on some level people still want her to be real, to berate her or whisper sweet nothings in her ear, and are prepared to elide the infinite layers of makeup, artifice and literal death in order to do so. But of course the woman herself has largely disappeared from view. You can’t throw an egg at deregulation. You can’t hurl paint over decades of rising house prices. The devastated former industrial towns of the north, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales possess precious little erotic dominatrix power. Back to Grantham rail station we go, past the statue of another local hero, Isaac Newton (Google rating: 4.7), dodging the four lanes of traffic and a deregulated local bus as we cross the road outside the big Wetherspoons. On the other side, a shuttered cafe sits alongside a branch of the local estate agents, the latter staffed by young men and women wearing suits and headsets. Thatcher’s old school is now an academy. The station car park is now run by a private firm and charges £5.45 for 24 hours. Inside the station there is a choice of Costa or Starbucks. Maybe Tedford was right after all: it says she died in 2013, but as you can see, she is very much alive.",

    "article_text": "“I remember my father marching against the National Front in the 1970s. It felt like it was a minority. The majority of people are still decent. But now, the far right seems legitimised and popular,” Dabinderjit Singh, a retired senior civil servant said. Singh was reacting to Tommy Robinson’s 13 September far-right “unite the kingdom” rally, which drew 110,000 people to London. The rally’s attenders say they have a variety of concerns. But for some ethnic minority Britons, Saturday’s scenes were reminiscent of far-right marches 50 years ago. Hetticia McIntosh, 70, from Manchester, was returning from holiday via Heathrow when she was warned by a WhatsApp “community safety alert”, to “avoid travelling into London … especially if you are from an ethnic minority.” For ex-servicewoman McIntosh, the times evoke memories of her east London, Windrush generation youth – when “we lived through the skinheads” and racial abuse was daubed on walls. McIntosh knows exactly where racist sentiment can lead. The Home Office inexplicably refused to renew her and her husband’s British passports in the 1970s and 1980s, forcing them to leave the country for St Lucia for decades. She now fears, amid talk of “remigration” from the far right, hardening attitudes to legal migration in Westminster and a government struggling to convey a positive message of unity, that “another Windrush scandal” could happen. This year far-right groups have capitalised on asylum hotel protests, while the “raise the colours” campaign has led to St George’s and union flags being flown from lampposts and painted on roundabouts nationwide. While for many, the flags are a celebration of national pride, St George’s crosses have been grafittied, sometimes with slurs, on ethnic minority-owned businesses and places of worship including a Manchester church, a Reading mosque and a York Chinese takeaway. Last week, police in Oldbury, West Midlands received a report that a Sikh woman had been violently sexually assaulted and told: “You don’t belong here, get out.” Robinson condemned the attack, saying shortly before the rally there was a distinction between “bad scumbags” and “decent minorities”, and that “as we attempt to unite this kingdom against mass immigration … I will speak personally of the sacrifices and great contribution that the Sikh community have made to Great Britain.” For Singh, among community leaders dealing with the attack’s aftermath, Robinson’s remarks are part of a “divide and rule” tactic in which the right has tried to “cozy up to Sikhs” and contrast them with Muslims, while Sikhs with “turbans and beards” were increasingly targeted in racial attacks after 9/11. “I think we are in more worrying, dangerous times than the 70s,” Singh said. “We have people playing on the sentiments of the majority in many countries – not just the UK, but the US, Europe, in India.” The rhetoric, in and out of Westminster, is leaving some ethnic minority Britons with long memories wondering how far things could go. Labour proposes doubling the standard qualifying period for settled status for legal, taxpaying skilled migrants from five years to 10 years. Last week, Tory MP Katie Lam said this was “not enough”, adding: “No new visa should be issued to, no new ILR [indefinite leave to remain] status should be granted to, and existing ILR status should be revoked from those who have committed a crime, accessed state support or are unlikely to contribute more than they cost. Those who have no legal way to stay here would then need to leave.” McIntosh, who has already experienced the Windrush scandal’s unofficial “remigration” scheme said: “History is repeating itself. That should frighten us all. Because no society can move forward if it keeps repeating the same prejudice. “We deserve dignity, not fear, in our later years. The more things change, the more they remain the same. When I saw that rally in London, it brought me right back. It’s heartbreaking. It’s down to a lack of teaching. If you did not go there, we would not be here.” Nigel Bromage, founder of counter-extremism group Exit Hate, also hears history’s echoes. He was in the National Front and Combat 18 in the 1980s and 1990s, before turning his back on neo-nazism. He said: “We are living in dark times – we ignore these signs at our peril. While the London rally was presented as an inclusive event, it attracted not only frustrated and unheard individuals but also hardcore British nationalists and neo-Nazis, all of whom seek to spread their message. “The underlying conditions for such movements – economic inequality, social grievances and a sense of disenfranchisement – have all been present for some time.” The prospect of a far-right, Elon Musk-backed government no longer seems unthinkable, a representative of the UK Indian Muslim Council said. “Minorities feel trapped,” he said. “Like they don’t belong anywhere. I was driving recently with my wife by my side and someone rolled down their window, called me [the p-word] and drove off.” The British Muslim Trust (BMT), the government’s new Islamophobia monitoring partner, says the atmosphere is deeply concerning. BMT chief executive, Akeela Ahmed, added: “There is no question that events like Saturday – which saw divisive rhetoric and despicable levels of violence – are causing deep unease. “We have had multiple reports of Muslim women taking extra precautions in recent weeks, with many choosing to stay at home on Saturday. This is intolerable.” For Singh, there is concern that the government is unable or unwilling to tackle racism. “I want [home secretary] Shabana Mahmood, as a Muslim woman, not simply to focus on immigration, but deal with racism and attacks against women. “If she fails in that, then I think the writing is on the wall that we don’t have a political leadership that can get out of the ballot box politics authoritarian states go towards, which is please the majority and penalise minorities.” Meanwhile, anti-racist campaigners the Runnymede Trust fear mainstream politicians have “lost control of this narrative to the likes of (Elon) Musk” after “legitimising racism”. They added: “It is significant that Saturday was also Stephen Lawrence’s birthday. Racism kills.” Angela Rayner was developing a social cohesion strategy before her resignation. A spokesperson for the communities department said: “Racism is completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. “We are determined to bridge divisions between communities and the work of the social cohesion taskforce will continue, reporting to the prime minister.”",

    "article_text": "Mitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen. The 36-year-old played 94 matches for West Coast in a career that ended in 2016. He identifies as a bisexual man and is in a long-term relationship with a woman. Brown said it would have been difficult had he spoken publicly during his playing career, but was motivated to help change the culture within the sport. “Maybe a second person [comes out], and then the third…,” he told The Daily Aus. “You may be playing with someone who’s in the queer community. Empathy is powerful.” Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. But suspensions have been unable to address the root causes of the game’s struggle to accept diversity among its players. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown said. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter The news was widely welcomed on social media. In addition to messages from fans and supporters, the AFL Players’ Association described the post as “powerful” and the GWS Giants’ account responded with a heart emoji. Pride Cup CEO Hayley Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+ communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “To be honest, I did not think I would ever see the day when either an ex or current AFL men’s player would come out,” she said. “I felt like we were so far away from this, which is really, really exciting, that someone has done it. It shouldn’t take courage to tell the world who you are, but it is extremely courageous from Mitch. “In the light of what the community went through last week, I thought that it’s even more brave that he decided to do it around this time and to speak up about his experiences.” Brown grew up in Ballarat and was drafted into the AFL with pick 16 in 2006. The defender debuted the following year and spent a decade in the competition before playing his final game at age 27, an elimination final against the Western Bulldogs. “I got to the end of my career and I was asked to play on for a couple more years, and I was over it. I was done,” he said. “I craved talking to someone and not being judged. I craved the ability to choose who I wanted to be around, rather than to fit into a team.” He said he had “buried” questions about his own sexuality due to the “hyper-masculine” environment, and that slurs were so constant they “just became part of the normal conversation”. “There have been so many times in my life I’ve seen things or heard things and not said anything … in fear of people thinking I was gay or bisexual.” Brown said he empathises with those currently playing, and it is easier for him as a past player to speak up. “I don’t have to run out there at the MCG in front of 80,000 fans next week … and fear the comments being thrown at me.” Dr Erik Denison, behavioural scientist with Monash faculty of arts, said the way in which Brown came out – voicing criticism of the homophobic environment he has experienced – could be a watershed moment. “What’s different here with Mitch coming out is that he is actually talking about the problems in his sport,” Denison said. “He’s talking openly about the homophobic environment being a factor in him deciding to retire from the game. We haven’t heard that kind of direct criticism before from other players who have come out, including in rugby union and also football in Australia, and so this is an important turning point. “I’m hopeful this could mean that Mitch’s story might have a bigger impact than other players who’ve come out, because he’s a respected AFL player, an insider, talking about the problems in the game. He isn’t an outsider. He’s one of the boys, which means his words will have an impact on those within the game.” AFL CEO Andrew Dillon acknowledged Brown’s courage in sharing his story and how important the moment was for the game. “Today is a step forward, and building on Mitch’s story we hope that others feel encouraged to be their authentic selves and share their own journeys, and that these stories are met with support from teammates, clubs and the wider football community,” Dillon said in a statement. “The AFL will continue to partner with our clubs, our Pride and Allies groups and the LGBTQI+ community to drive and celebrate inclusion across both our AFL and AFLW competitions. “Together, our commitment is to keep making football an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone to thrive — and that work never stops.” In contrast to the men’s game, the AFLW is a diverse competition which champions its many LGBTQ+ players and the community.",

    "article_text": "“Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far – diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued. Last week, Bettman was named alongside NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk and various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports council. The council will be responsible for – among other things – playing an “important role in restoring tradition to college athletics, including … keeping men out of women’s sports.” Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it. This is not the first time Bettman has given mixed messages around social issues. In 2023, for example, the NHL tried to host a career fair aimed at recruiting a more diverse workforce (its inclusivity report noted that the league’s employees were roughly 84% white and 93% straight). The event, attached to that year’s All Star Game in Florida, quickly caught the attention of the governor’s office, which accused the NHL of discrimination – against white people. The league cancelled the career fair. A few weeks later, the NHL again had the opportunity to stand for its diversity values when a handful of players refused to wear their team’s Pride-themed warmup jerseys. Instead, the NHL retreated meekly, encouraging “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues.” That June – Pride month, no less – Bettman cancelled the Pride jerseys altogether, calling the furor around them “a distraction” from the intended message. One wonders what he will call his own foray directly into the culture wars or, for that matter, how the NHL may characterize this particular moment of self-expression from the commissioner. It’s likely that Bettman’s participation in Trump’s sports council will fall into the “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues” category the league talked about during the Pride jerseys fiasco. But seeing as Trump seems fixated on getting trans women out of college sports – even though there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes in college sports, according to the president of the NCAA – this feels like a very specific kind of perspective on a cultural issue, doesn’t it? What’s so aggravating about repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from the NHL under the guise of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these views are all morally equivalent when they’re not. Sure, the players who refused to wear a Pride-themed jersey can’t be forced to wear them, but it’s not like it was simply a fashion choice. Fundamentally, those players made that decision based on a worldview that refuses to accept LGBTQ+ people, including their fellow hockey players, as being equal to them and everyone else. It’s not the jerseys that were the problem – but they did a great job highlighting it. Earlier this spring, Harrison Browne, the first transgender player in professional hockey, wrote that while in the NCAA, he was offered the option to have his own locker room and change his pronouns on the roster. “Looking back, I realize how important it is for trans and non-binary student athletes to have those options, whether or not they take them,” Browne wrote in The Walrus. “These choices provide a baseline of institutional acceptance and acknowledgment for gender-diverse athletes at all levels.” On Monday, Browne told the Guardian via email that “to see [Bettman, Gretzky, and Tkachuk] get behind an administration that is targeting marginalized communities, especially trans people in sports, is deeply disturbing and a huge step backwards in making hockey a more inclusive sport.” And going backwards really isn’t Bettman’s thing, or it never used to be. When he accepted his job as commissioner in 1992, he told a room full of reporters that “the way a league performs well is by making its product as attractive as it can to the greatest number of fans.” He believed in growth, in other words – even up until 2022. What he risks now is stagnation, regression even. On that same day in 1992, Bettman said that he wanted to make hockey, a sport that at the time was seen as violent and retrograde, more “user-friendly.” And he acknowledged that to do it, he’d need to push some of the older owners into the future. “It may be that we are going to head in new, progressive directions that will make sense to every one immediately,” Bettman said. “For some, it may take a little more time.” Maybe the diversity and inclusion stuff doesn’t totally make sense to Bettman in 2025 – other North American sports have decided that they don’t have the stomach to fight the culture wars under Trump either, and NFL commission Roger Goodell is also on the White House sports council. But Bettman should give the league’s diversity policies time to grow, rather than deliberately reversing course, hurting hockey’s players and fans, and ultimately jeopardising the future success of the sport for everyone. If that’s too much to ask, at the very least, if he’s invited to join a club created by a hostile and retrograde president, he should by now have the smarts to just say no.",

The playlists, which feature songs such as Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know and Apologize by OneRepublic, would make good soundtracks to romantic splits, but that’s not what they were. The playlists came together after Killawi was told by three different banks and payment processors they would no longer work with LaunchGood, the crowdfunding platform for the Muslim community she co-founded. Stripe said its banking partner instructed the company to cut ties with LaunchGood after five years of working with the crowdfunding platform. Stripe also told the company it couldn’t be associated with any international humanitarian work in sanctioned jurisdictions like Syria – a prerequisite for a crowdfunding platform that caters to the Muslim community. Another bank told the company there were too many Muslim and Arabic names and figuring out if those names belonged to sanctioned individuals was difficult. “People don’t realize Muhammad is the most sanctioned name,” Killawi, who was the chief operating officer at LaunchGood, said. With each dismissal, it felt like LaunchGood was on the brink of collapse. “If you can’t accept payments, you can’t exist as a company,” she said. There were few existing options that gave Killawi and her co-founders the stability and reliability they sought. So they did what a growing number of Muslim founders have done since: create their own solution. To mitigate the impact on the business if and when another bank decided to stop working with LaunchGood, Killawi and her co-founders Chris Blauvelt and Omar Hamid made the decision to establish a network of payment providers and banks to work with. Their hope was that there would no longer be one point of failure that could tank their business. When they were dumped by a bank, which continued to happen over the years, they had several backups. Now, more than 10 years since its founding, LaunchGood has become a household name and has enabled its largely Muslim user base to raise nearly $700m. While the platform also hosts personal fundraisers, LaunchGood is better known for its emphasis on charitable giving and has enabled its users to set up an automated donation for every day of the holy month of Ramadan. It has become the primary gateway for many during Ramadan, during which many Muslims donate to charities on a daily basis. The site’s rise and the challenges it has faced are not an anomaly. The “halal” consumer market, which includes halal food, financial services and other goods and services that cater to Muslims, has grown to an estimated $2tn globally, according to research and advisory firm Dinar Standard. Yet a 2022 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims were more likely than other faith groups to have their accounts at banks and other US financial institutions closed, investigated or otherwise challenged, with businesses effectively denying themselves access to Muslim customers. That’s why Killawi has stepped away from her day-to-day responsibilities as chief operating officer of LaunchGood to start a sister company, a payments processor called PayGood in 2024. She hopes to provide for Muslim businesses and charities what LaunchGood’s team had to hack together for themselves: a reliable payment system that doesn’t discriminate. “When [my co-founders and I] started out 11 years ago, we just wanted to build community,” Killawi said. “We never thought we’d have to become compliance experts. At some point it felt so existential. Can you even survive if you don’t have financial access in this world?” While LaunchGood was among the early entrants into the largely untapped Muslim-friendly tech space, its sister company is part of a growing class of tech and software companies that aim to cater to Muslims in the US, Canada and the UK. But what it means to be a Muslim-friendly business has started to shift since the 7 October attack by Hamas. Targeting Muslim consumers has always meant, to some degree, aligning with the ethics and values of the Muslim community – whether that was providing a halal-friendly dating app, interest-free loans or modest clothes. Now, this new crop of players that provide Muslim-friendly technology are also either overtly or implicitly working to address a growing demand among its intended customers: make it easier to stop contributing to Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. “What happened in Gaza this past year hit a very different nerve,” Killawi said. “Palestine is an evergreen issue for Muslims, but the level and scale of destruction of this past year was unlike any other. It accelerated this overall Islamic ecosystem and economy. There’s a new consciousness of people saying: ‘Let me really make sure I vote with my dollars.’” Even PayGood, which is still in beta, has begun to emerge as an alternative to major payments processors such as Stripe and PayPal as Muslims navigate whether these existing platforms align with their values. PayPal stopped provided services to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza in 2021. Muslim and pro-Palestinian founders have begun to question the leadership at Stripe. In late November, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison posted a picture from Tel Aviv – a move many took as tacit approval of the Israeli government and its actions. In the weeks since then, Killawi said she has had at least 20 calls with founders looking for a simple payments solution and alternative. “This is the most I’ve seen the Muslim community draw a line. They’re saying: ‘I want to put my money where my mouth is,’” Killawi said. “They feel ethically very conflicted. People just want to switch over to a product that aligns with their values.” The official movement to end international support for Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and siege of Gaza, called Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS), is nearly 20 years old. But in this past year, more Muslims took up the cause of spending their money in accordance with that movement. More companies are answering the community’s call for “BDS-safe” alternatives, and boycotting the major brands on the official BDS list is beginning to feel sustainable. The growing appetite for considered consumption is in part what inspired Adil Abbuthalha to start Boycat. In its current form, the app allows people to scan or search for brands to determine whether they have any ties to or involvement in activities that “support Israeli occupation, apartheid or violate Palestinian rights”. Abbuthalha has also launched a website that suggests alternatives to those brands when possible. Ultimately, Abbuthalha hopes the app will become the primary “ethical alternatives marketplace”, not just for issues relating to Palestine but all human rights violations. “To empower someone to make the right decision and vote with their wallet, we need to create a BDS-like tool that not only tells you what to avoid, it also tells you what to spend your money on instead,” Abbuthalha said. “We want to make ethical shopping effortless.” Without alternatives, divesting from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation is difficult. Yet when Nourin Abubaker and Yara Ourfali started a home-swapping platform called Makani Homes less than a year ago, they didn’t set out to create a pro-Palestinian alternative to Airbnb. They wanted to give Muslims more options that accommodated the community’s often shared preferences such as alcohol- or pork-free homes or homes with bidets. But the duo launched the platform at a time when many Muslims were looking to rely less on Airbnb after it reversed a ban on renting homes that were illegally built in the occupied West Bank. As of 2020, Airbnb had 200 listings in the West Bank, according to Amnesty International, which urged the company to “stop benefiting from illegal settlements built on stolen Palestinian land”. As Makani has expanded its offerings, the founders have become more comfortable positioning the app as a means to spend less money on companies that operate in the West Bank. The site, which until now exclusively offered its users the ability to swap homes, just launched a home rental service much like Airbnb’s. The company also organizes Muslim-friendly experiences. “Boycotting just got easier,” the subject line of a recent email introducing the company’s rental services read. The email goes on to talk about supporting a “community-driven business” instead of a “major travel corporation” that has listings in the occupied territories. “Our whole purpose is to let people know that just because companies exist and they’re huge doesn’t mean that you always have to give your money to them,” Abubaker said. Back in 2013, Killawi and her co-founders struggled to raise money to start LaunchGood. At the time, she says, few people were willing to take a bet on the Muslim community and even fewer on a Muslim-focused crowdfunding platform. In the years since then, investors have increasingly recognized the financial opportunity in backing Muslim-focused businesses. In 2017, a halal dating app, Muzz, became the first ever Muslim-centric app to be backed by Y Combinator. The halal investment platform Wahed has raised nearly $95m and was last valued at $300m. These companies have in many ways paved the path for startups such as Boycat and Makani, enabling a much less hostile fundraising environment for a Muslim-run company. And in the last year, as more in tech have become more active around the cause of Palestine, an infrastructure for pro-Palestinian companies has also materialized. Paul Biggar, who was kicked off the board of a company he founded after writing a pro-Palestinian blogpost, started an incubator called Tech for Palestine that aims to provide support for companies that are advocating in some way for Palestinian freedom. As of November, the incubator was supporting 36 projects including Boycat. While Tech for Palestine differs from a traditional incubator in some ways – it doesn’t provide funding at the moment and not all the companies it supports are startups – those running it provide startup-like advice focused on how to advance the goal of supporting the pro-Palestinian movement, Biggar said. “We’re trying to address the complicity of the tech industry in various different ways,” Biggar said. “The theme of everything we’re doing is supporting Palestine, either indirectly or directly.” Being outwardly pro-Palestinian has still presented some challenges. Abbuthalha said the vast majority of venture capital firms won’t go near Boycat, though it boasts a good deal of momentum. The app surpassed a million users in less than a year and has partnered with the official BDS movement. Despite the challenges Muslim-run and pro-Palestinian companies face, Killawi remains bullish about businesses that cater to the Muslim community. “The time is now,” she said. “It’s a lot easier to get things started today than when we first started. Just start small, it’s worth taking a bet on this community.”",

    "article_text": "The co-chair of Meta’s oversight board said the company’s systems had become “too complex”, as the chief executive of Elon Musk’s X welcomed its decision to scrap factcheckers. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the co-chair of the social media company’s oversight board and the former prime minister of Denmark, has said she and the departed president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, had agreed “Meta systems have been too complex”, adding that there had been “over-enforcement”. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg made the surprise announcement that the Facebook owner would move away from using third-party checkers to flag misleading content in favour of notes from other users. The 40-year-old billionaire said that, starting in the US, Meta would “get rid of factcheckers and replace them with community notes similar to X”, as the company moves to prioritise free speech in the run-up to Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The move came only days after Clegg, Britain’s former deputy prime minister, left Meta after six years at the company, most recently in the role of president of global affairs. In a departure post on Facebook, Clegg said he was proud of having worked on “new forms of governance”. During his time at Meta, he helped to establish the Facebook oversight board, an independent board that makes decisions on the social network’s moderation policies. Thorning-Schmidt told the BBC: “There are huge problems in what Mark Zuckerberg has announced yesterday and that’s why the existence of an oversight board is so important. We welcome looking into factchecking. We welcome that message, looking into the complexity and perhaps over-enforcement. “We’re very concerned about gender rights, LGBTQ+ rights, trans people’s rights on the platforms because we are seeing many instances where hate speech can lead to real-life harm, so we will be watching that space very carefully.” Clegg will be replaced by Joel Kaplan, who previously served as the deputy chief of staff for policy under the former president George W Bush, months after Trump’s election victory. Thorning-Schmidt said Clegg had “talked about leaving for a long time”. Her comments came as Linda Yaccarino, the head of X, welcomed Meta’s decision, saying “welcome to the party” during an appearance at the CES technology show in Las Vegas, hours after Zuckerberg announced the policy shift. The change will mean the social network moves away from third-party checkers to flag misleading content in favour of user-based notes. These have been introduced widely in recent years on X, formerly known as Twitter, particularly after Musk cut content moderators amid mass sackings after he bought the company in 2022. The decision by Meta, which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has been widely criticised by online safety campaigners and commentators, who said it would enable the flow of misinformation and harmful content. Yaccarino described Meta’s decision as “really exciting” during an onstage question and answer session at CES. She said X’s community notes were “good for the world” and the system was “the most effective, fastest factchecking, without bias”. She said: “Think about it as this global collective consciousness, keeping each other accountable at global scale in real time. And it couldn’t be more validating than to see that Mark and Meta realised that.” Yaccarino added: “Human behaviour is inspired because when a post is noted, it’s dramatically shared less, so that’s the power of community notes.” Wearing a rare Swiss watch, reportedly worth almost $900,000 (£722,607), Zuckerberg called Meta’s current moderation system “too politically biased”, although he admitted that changes to the way the company filtered content would mean “we’re going to catch less bad stuff”.",

    "article_text": "Against a backdrop of red stage curtains at one of Oslo’s most prominent LGBTQ+ spaces, the Church of Norway apologised for the discrimination and harm it had inflicted. “The church in Norway has caused LGBTQ+ people shame, great harm and pain,” the presiding bishop, Olav Fykse Tveit, said on Thursday. “This should never have happened and that is why I apologise today.” The “discrimination, unequal treatment and harassment” had caused some to lose their faith, Tveit acknowledged. A church service at Oslo Cathedral was scheduled to follow his apology. The apology took place at the London Pub, one of two bars targeted in the 2022 shooting that killed two people and left nine seriously injured during Oslo’s Pride celebrations. A Norwegian of Iranian origin, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for the killings. Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church. In the 1950s, the church’s bishops described gay people as a “social danger of global proportions”. But as Norwegian society became increasingly liberal, becoming the second in the world to allow same-sex registered partnerships in 1993 and in 2009 the first Scandinavian country to allow same-sex marriage, the church slowly followed. In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able to marry in church since 2017. In 2023, Tveit participated in Oslo’s Pride parade in what was described as a first for the church. Thursday’s apology was met with a mixed reaction. The head of a network of Christian lesbians in Norway, Hanne Marie Pedersen-Eriksen, herself a gay pastor, described it as “an important reparation” and a moment that “finally marked the end of a dark chapter in the church’s history”. For Stephen Adom, the head of Norway’s Association for Gender and Sexual Diversity, the apology was “strong and important” but had come “too late for those among us who died of Aids … with hearts filled with anguish because the church considered the epidemic to be God’s punishment”. Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the Church of England apologised for what it described as its “shameful” treatment, though it continues to refuse to allow same-sex marriages in church. Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last year apologised for its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman. Earlier this year, the United Church of Canada offered an apology to two spirit and LGBTQIA+ communities, describing it as a reaffirmation of the church’s “commitment to radical hospitality and full inclusion” in all aspects of church life. “We have failed to celebrate and delight in all of your beautiful creation,” Rev Michael Blair, the general secretary of the church, said. “We have wounded people instead of seeking wholeness. We are sorry.” With contributions from Agence France-Presse and Reuters",

    "article_text": "Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power. Azruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government. Facing 11 charges in a Florida court – including money laundering, bribery and tax evasion – they were released later the same day after posting bail of 150,000 Guyanese dollars each (about £547 or $719.95), but must report to the court weekly and will face a new hearing on Monday. Mohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media. Mohabir Anil Nandlall, Guyana’s attorney general, said the case was a “legal obligation” arising from the country’s international commitments – a 1931 extradition treaty between the UK and the US remains in force in Guyana, which became independent from Britain in 1966. The case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita. “It’s a situation where the status quo in Guyana is being challenged,” said Peter Wickham, a political scientist and director of a polling company in the Caribbean. Mohamed founded a party and announced his candidacy just three months before the presidential election, breaking with the country’s long-standing two-party system that has traditionally pitted the president’s PPP/C, broadly backed by the Indo-Guyanese population, against the APNU, generally supported by Afro-Guyanese voters. Mohamed urged Guyanese to reject “tribal voting” and, running on a populist, anti-establishment platform, promised to push for renegotiation of the oil deal – despite the country’s newly discovered oil wealth, more than half of its population still lives in poverty. “He hoped to become a kind of balance of power for whoever won the election, but the result ended up being better than he expected,” Wickham said. The incumbent Ali won, and his party secured 36 of the 65 seats in congress. But unlike in previous elections, it was not the APNU that emerged as the main opposition force – it won only 12 seats – but Mohamed’s party, with 16. Last Monday, three days after Mohamed was arrested and released on bail, he was sworn in alongside the rest of the new congress. He arrived in the Lamborghini at the centre of an alleged mail fraud case against him, in which he is accused of submitting a false $75,300 invoice for a vehicle said to have cost $680,000. Although the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024. In June 2024, a shipment containing about $5.3m in gold bars sent from Guyana by Mohamed’s Enterprise was seized at Miami international airport. That same month, the Mohameds were sanctioned by the US Department of Treasury on charges of gold smuggling, evading more than $50m in taxes owed to the Guyanese government and bribing local public officials. At a press conference last week, vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo – who led the country between 1999 and 2011 – said the extradition request came from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. “You see his signature there? ‘Marco Rubio,’” he said. “It’s not a junior man in Florida … that’s the seriousness [of it] … We are part of a treaty. We are part of an international community that believes people must pay for their crimes,” said Jagdeo. Mohamed and his lawyers declined to comment to the Guardian, but have previously denied wrongdoing. In addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition. The lawyers said they intend to challenge the case at every level, including the constitutional court and, ultimately, the Caribbean court of justice. Wickham said the case is likely to drag on. “While it goes on, he [Mohamed] remains a member of parliament … and I think he will continue to make life as difficult as he can for the government in his role as opposition leader,” he said.",
    "summary_text": "In addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition. Azruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government. Mohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media. Although the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024. The case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita. Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power. Mohabir Anil Nandlall, Guyana’s attorney general, said the case was a “legal obligation” arising from the country’s international commitments – a 1931 extradition treaty between the UK and the US remains in force in Guyana, which became independent from Britain in 1966."

    "article_text": "As if truffling thuggishly in pursuit of the Nobel peace prize wasn’t enough, the spectacle of bulldozers ripping into the White House is yet more evidence of Donald Trump’s unstinting quest for epic self-aggrandisement. Having decreed the East Wing not fit for purpose – namely, his purposes of swank and show – he plans to replace it with a faux classical bulletproof ballroom, capable of seating up to 650 partygoers. Renderings show a vast, glacially white aircraft hangar of a structure embellished with an ornate coffered ceiling, gilded Corinthian columns and drooping gold chandeliers. Nero, who conceived the original domus aurea, would feel right at home. Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will. On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden. So, having been here before, the American Institute of Architects is wearily wary, stating: “AIA is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities, mandate official federal design preferences, or otherwise hinder design freedom, and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings.” White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing, Richard Nixon installed a bowling lane and Harry S Truman commissioned an entire reconstruction. Several first ladies have revamped the decor and furnishings, notably Jackie Kennedy, whose soigné interiors were designed to connect the presidential home more resonantly with American history. The now doomed East Wing, dating from 1902, has been a much-changed addition. Intermittently housing the office of the first lady, what’s left of it sits above the presidential emergency operations centre, a high security bunker built during the second world war. Vice-president Dick Cheney and his retinue retreated there during the 9/11 attacks, as did Trump at the start of the George Floyd protests in 2020. The man who landed the ballroom job is James McCrery, founder of Washington-based McCrery Architects and a trenchant advocate of classical architecture. “Americans love classical architecture,” he has said, “because it is our formative architecture – and we love our nation’s formation.” Ironically, McCrery began his career working for Peter Eisenman, the high priest of deconstructivism, before a conversion of Damascene proportions prompted him to renounce the avant garde and “rethink his modernist education”. Specialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC. Trump’s style edicts and building bombast exude a dictator-for-life megalomania vibe, as he barrels through his second term, with an unconstitutional third potentially in his sights. However, he is said to dislike the White House, finding it on the poky side, preferring to decamp to his Floridian resort Mar-a-Lago at every opportunity. The tone for his latest stay in the White House was set by his patio-fication of the Rose Garden, but he is now clearly aiming for a legacy more substantial than a bit of paving. His record as a “patron” of architecture has been shaped by his rollercoaster career as a property developer. To him, buildings are simply extruded capital. He has an enduring fondness for Louis XIV bling, epitomised by his enrobing of a 1960s Manhattan skyscraper in golden bronze cladding to transform it into the gleamingly phallic Trump International Hotel and Tower. His more recent engoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared to a professional wrestler’s dressing room. Nonetheless, Trump’s experience as a developer was formative, in that it taught him he could get away with just about anything. It crystallised a poisonous bravado, now hardwired into the national political sphere. His fetishisation of classicism, a historically recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes, is bleakly predictable. “It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.” Another imperial wheeze, announced at a reception for prospective ballroom donors, is a huge triumphal arch, to be erected just across the Potomac river from the Lincoln Memorial. Modelled on the Parisian original and topped with a gilded, winged goddess of victory, the “Arc de Trump” is intended to commemorate the US’s 250th anniversary next year. In launching this newest vanity project, Trump said: “We love to fix up Washington.” Again, Nero would doubtless approve.",
    "summary_text": "Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will. White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. His more recent engoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared to a professional wrestler’s dressing room. “It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.” On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden. Specialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC."

    "article_text": "Bob Vylan frontman Bobby Vylan is “not regretful” of his “death, death to the IDF” chant at Glastonbury and said he would “do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays”. The outspoken punk duo sparked controversy when they led chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, at the festival in June. The chant was condemned by Glastonbury and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described it as “appalling hate speech”. Bob Vylan was dropped by its agency UTA, and the US state department revoked the member’s visas, forcing them to cancel a North American tour. Speaking on The Louis Theroux Podcast in his first interview since Glastonbury, Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, was asked if he would do it all again. He replied: “Oh yeah. Like what if I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes I would do it again. I’m not regretful of it. I’d do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays. He said the backlash the band had faced was “minimal compared to what people in Palestine are going through”. “I don’t want to overstate the importance of the chant,” he added. “That’s not what I’m trying to do, but if I have their support, they’re the people that I’m doing it for, they’re the people that I’m being vocal for, then what is there to regret? Oh, because I’ve upset some rightwing politician or some rightwing media?” Vylan’s conversation with Theroux was recorded on 1 October. At the start of the episode, the presenter states that it took place before the Manchester synagogue attacks on 2 October, in which two people were killed and three others injured, and before the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on 10 October. The musician said he was taken aback by the uproar sparked by the chant, and claimed members of BBC staff at Glastonbury told him on the day that the set was “fantastic”. The corporation’s executive complaints unit (ECU) has since found the BBC’s broadcast of the performance breached editorial standards in relation to harm and offence. Vylan told Theroux there was no sign of a controversy in the moment: “It wasn’t like we came off stage, and everybody was like [gasps]. It’s just normal. We come off stage. It’s normal. Nobody thought anything. Nobody. Even staff at the BBC were like ‘That was fantastic! We loved that!’” Vylan also hit back at Damon Albarn from Blur, who called the chant “one of the most spectacular misfires I’ve seen in my life” and described Vylan as “goose-stepping in tennis gear”. Albarn’s reaction was “disappointing” and “lacked self-awareness”, Vylan said. “I just want to say that categorising it as a ‘spectacular misfire’ implies that somehow the politics of the band or our stance on Palestinian liberation is not thought out,” he said. “I take great issue with the phrase ‘goose-stepping’ being used because it’s only used around Nazi Germany,” he added. “That’s it. And for him to use that language, I think is disgusting. I think his response was disgusting.” Asked what he meant by the chant “Death to the IDF,” Vylan said the chant itself was “unimportant”. “What is important is the conditions that exist to allow that chant to even take place on that stage. And I mean, the conditions that exist in Palestine. Where the Palestinian people are being killed at an alarming rate. Who cares about the chant?” he said. “Death to the IDF” rhymes, he added: “‘End, End the IDF’ does not rhyme, wouldn’t have caught on, would it? … We are there to entertain. We are there to play music. I am a lyricist. ‘Death, Death to IDF’ rhymes. Perfect chant.” Vylan also rejected claims from the Community Security Trust (CST), a monitoring and Jewish community safety organisation, that their set contributed to a spike in antisemitic incidents reported two days later. “I don’t think I have created an unsafe atmosphere for the Jewish community. If there were large numbers of people going out and going like ‘Bob Vylan made me do this’. I might go, oof, I’ve had a negative impact here,” he said. When Vylan said he thought the band had been criticised more heavily than others for speaking about the conflict, Theroux mentioned the Irish band Kneecap, who have also faced backlash for their approach to pro-Palestine messaging. “That’s an interesting one,” Vylan said, “because as with everything race comes to play a part in that we are an easier villain, no pun intended, than they are because we are already the enemy.” Press Association contributed to this report.",

    "article_text": "Jane Plastow, who has died of cancer aged 66, was an academic and theatre-maker based at the University of Leeds who made invaluable contributions to the fields of community-based theatre, African studies and global development. Jane led the Centre for African Studies at Leeds from 2004 to 2014, overseeing the innovative theatre and global development MA. In 2006 she was made professor of African theatre, with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka attending her inaugural lecture. A pivotal point in Jane’s career came in the 1990s with her long-term projects with Eritrean artists and educators in the aftermath of the war of independence. Most recently, Jane had a longstanding collaboration with We Are Walukuba, a community group in Jinja, Uganda. Over a decade, Jane and collaborators challenged the dominant short-term and message-based conventions of theatre for development by co-creating new approaches to challenge existing social issues. These long-term dialogical forms of artistic engagement promoted grassroots knowledge and discussion between community members and wider stakeholders. Her experience led to the publication of her two-volume A History of East African Theatre (2020, 2021), followed by Community-Based Arts, Research and Activism in Uganda: We Are Walukuba (2025), and her forthcoming monograph Somali Musical Theatre (2026). Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, she was the daughter of Mary (nee Luckett), a legal secretary, and Gerald Plastow, who worked in local government. After attending Tunbridge Wells Girls’ grammar school, Jane completed a BA in English at the University of Manchester in 1981. She then travelled to Africa for the first time, undertaking a teaching post in the Gambia. This job would mark the beginning of a 44-year collaborative relationship with African artists, activists and educators traversing many countries including Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Somaliland, Djibouti and Zimbabwe. After her time in the Gambia, Jane became a lecturer at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, for three years. She then completed an MPhil and a PhD at Manchester, before moving to the Ulster University at Coleraine in 1991 to lecture in theatre studies, and then to Leeds in 1994. Jane acted as PhD supervisor for many students, many of whom went on to hold senior positions at leading African universities. In her years after her cancer diagnosis, Jane became interested in growing authoritarianism in the UK when her son, Will, was arrested for pro-Palestinian activism. Her uncompleted final book, provisionally titled Keir Starmer’s Political Prisoners, consisted of interviews with British political prisoners, and highlighted the increasingly severe state crackdown on dissent in the UK. Jane was a collaborator who truly believed, inhabited and realised the political power of the arts. She had an unrelenting and unstoppable energy and an enormous sense of fun. She is survived by Will, her brother, John, and sisters Beverley and Caroline.",

    "article_text": "A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. “Because of those posts, I lost my job. Today, after nearly seven years, the court of appeal has finally put that right. Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Sean Jones KC, acting for Farmor’s, said in earlier written submissions that Higgs was not dismissed for manifesting her beliefs “but because the manner in which it was manifested could reasonably have caused and did cause others to think she was expressing homophobic or transphobic views”. He argued remitting the case was appropriate as “fuller reasons” for the decision were needed. In a 57-page ruling, Underhill said Higgs’s posts were not grossly offensive but a series of derogatory sneers. “I do not believe that dismissal was even arguably a proportionate sanction for the claimant’s conduct,” he added. A spokesperson for Stonewall said: “Today’s court of appeal ruling is a judgment on the proportionality of her dismissal, not an endorsement of the beliefs she expressed. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” The Press Association contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "The Greens are coming directly to challenge Labour, the party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, has told its conference, saying that as things stand, Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Addressing a packed event in Bournemouth, Polanski condemned what he called Labour’s “managed decline” and the aping of Reform policies in areas such as migration. Polanski, who is Jewish and grew up in Manchester, expressed his horror at the attack on a synagogue in the city on Thursday and made a strong defence of migration. “This is a party not afraid to say migration has helped make this country what we are today. And it’s made this party too,” said Polanski, who changed his surname from Paulden to Polanski when he was 18, reversing the anglicisation his relatives adopted when they arrived from eastern Europe. Polanski, who won the election to lead the party in England and Wales last month, cited his background and those of the party’s deputy leaders, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward. “I’m one of five Jewish people to lead a British political party in the last 100 years,” he said. “And that also means that I do want to spend a moment to mark yesterday’s awful attack. As a Jewish man raised in north Manchester – I feel this deeply and my heart is with the community. “More widely I am the product of migration. It’s why defending migrants matters so much to me. It’s a common Jewish experience – a tale as old as time.” His ancestors, who moved to England from Latvia via Ukraine and Poland, still faced antisemitism in the UK, he said: “They changed their name to sound more English – and I changed it back, knowing that real pride comes from no longer hiding who you are.” His deputies, Polanski went on, were Ali, the son of a steelworker whose parents came to the UK from what is now Bangladesh in the 60s, and Millward, who “has family roots tied to England as far back as she knows”. He said: “One brought up Jewish. One raised Muslim. One a child of the church. A leadership with three different backstories, in a country enriched by people from all over the world.” With Green membership having risen rapidly since Polanski’s victory and climbing to more than 80,000 for the first time, he told the event that it was time for the party to be ambitious. “Everything we do between now and the next election must be bold,” he said. “We have a vision for this place we call home. Boldness means connecting with how hard it is right now for so many people. It means listening, not just finger-pointing. “At every opportunity, from the doorstep to the TV studio, our message is that the Green party will bring down your bills, cut the cost of living and protect our NHS.” In a series of attacks on the government, Polanski said it had no apparent answers to the problems created by austerity and inequality. “Its politics is one of managed decline dressed up as national renewal and draped in Reform-bating policymaking,” he said. “More of the same from Keir Starmer won’t just fail us now, it will hand this country on a plate to the dark forces around Nigel Farage.” Polanski particularly took aim at Starmer for, he said, trying to copy Reform, including over migration and asylum, “When Farage says jump, Labour might say, ‘How high?’” he said. “But the Greens won’t dance to the tune of a Trump-loving, tax-avoiding, science-denying, NHS-dismantling corporate stooge. We will say it loud, and we will say it clear: migrants and refugees are welcome here.” The arrival of the media-savvy Polanski, who won an overwhelming 85% of the membership vote against a joint bid by two of the party’s MPs, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, has brought the Greens new members and extra attention, with more journalists attending the gathering in Bournemouth than the party’s previous conferences. Polanski said the time had come for the party to take the fight to Labour. “It’s why Labour councillors are defecting. It’s why Labour members are joining. It’s why thousands upon thousands of ex-Labour voters are saying enough is in enough and putting a cross next to the Green party for the first time. Labour’s arrogant assumptions that it is entitled to people’s vote ends today.”",

    "article_text": "I have always been interested in gender and identity stories. In South Africa, we have a strong liberal constitution on paper for queer rights, but the reality on the streets – the hate crimes, the animosity in the workplace and in social settings – is very different. I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. That led me to the drag pageant scene. I would go to photograph pageants every weekend, and every Monday I would get messages from the people I’d photographed asking me to send the pictures – so I had a lot of instant feedback on the work I was making. I was using harsh lighting to play with the idea of masculine and feminine, to emphasise the contrast between the strong jawlines and the feminine personae. But there’s no one more honest than a drag queen, and very early on, someone told me they really didn’t like the picture I’d taken of them. It was hard to hear, but letting go of my ego I asked this person why. They said it was because they didn’t look beautiful. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. I changed my approach. And if I hadn’t had that knock to my ego, the work wouldn’t have become what it needed to be. Over the next year and a half, making the work became a conversation with the drag queens. I put it out there that I wanted to do a collaborative project. Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. The idea was to work with other drag artists and visit places where acts of violence had happened, and to reclaim these places. I told Belinda to think about who should tell this story – I wanted her to consider carefully if I was the right person. Two weeks later, she came back and said she wanted to work with me. I was concerned for the drag queens’ safety, not only while going to these sites of violence and making the images but also after, as some of them lived in the townships where the portraits would be made. I sat with it for a while. But one thing Belinda said stuck with me. She said: “If we don’t go, if we don’t reclaim these spaces and make these pictures, then it’s like we don’t exist.” The entire series was shot in four hours. We met at a petrol station on the day, so the drag queens could get ready – everyone had specific ideas about what they wanted to wear. We moved quickly and didn’t linger. I was definitely nervous – it made me realise how these people feel every day, you can never fully relax. I photographed Belinda at the shisanyama – a community space where women cook and sell meat – in Khayelitsha, a township located on the Cape Flats, near Cape Town. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was the end of the day and the light was really good – everything came together, with the lady in the background staring. If you look carefully, you can see my shadow – I love that I’m a part of it, that always makes me smile. Belinda has such a regal, enigmatic presence. There’s something about her – I hope it comes across in the image. Afterwards we organised a show at a community hall in Khayelitsha. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It’s amazing to have global exposure for the issues we care about, but none of that is as valuable as showing the work in the space it was created. Lee-Ann Olwage’s CV Born: Durban, 1986 Trained: “I’m a self-trained photographer but studied film directing at AFDA film school in Cape Town.” Influences: “My peers, life, the stories I work on, and other forms of storytelling: painting, music, weaving, textile art.” High point: “Winning the World Press Photo award in 2020. It wasn’t so much the award but the fact that people celebrated a story I loved and my way of seeing the world. It gave me a new confidence that helped me take the next steps in my career.” Low point: “Working with a journalist who was not respectful of the community we were in.

This image is part of the World Press Photo print sale, 17-26 November, in celebration of World Press Photo at 70 I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It wasn’t so much the award but the fact that people celebrated a story I loved and my way of seeing the world."

    "article_text": "Home-to-school transport costs in England have risen to £2.3bn a year, as increasing numbers of children with special educational needs and disabilities travel farther afield to schools that can meet their requirements, according to a report. More than half a million children and young people up to the age of 25 now get council-funded transport from their home to school or college, triggering a £415m overspend by local authorities last year, the National Audit Office (NAO) found. Of the 470,000 children under 16 who benefit, about 40% (180,000) have special educational needs and disabilities (Send), but councils spend approximately five times more on transport for Send pupils than others (£8,116 v £1,526), as they often have to travel further in single-occupancy taxis, contributing to a 70% real-terms increase in spending overall in the past eight years. Home-to-school transport is one of the fastest growing areas of local authority spending, according to the NAO, at a time when councils are struggling with growing deficits due to the sharp rise in the number of children and young people being assessed as needing education, health and care plans. The BBC reported this week that Reform UK’s George Finch, who became leader of Warwickshire county council at age 18, wrote to the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, seeking permission to revise the rules around pupil eligibility for free transport to save money. Phillipson said the plans, which could see pupils as young as eight walking up to five miles to school, showed Reform posed a danger to children. The government announced last week it was delaying the publication of its long-awaited white paper detailing plans to overhaul Send provision until next year. In its report on Friday, the NAO urged ministers to address home-to-school transport as part of its Send reforms. Local authorities are required to provide free transport for school-age children who cannot walk to their nearest suitable school due to distance, special educational needs or disabilities, or safety concerns, with extra support for low-income families. Because of the growing bill, however, the NAO said many councils were reducing provision of additional discretionary transport. As well as the increase in Send pupils, expenditure has gone up because of increased transport costs and growing demand due to public transport cuts in rural areas. “Local authorities are making savings to meet their statutory duties, but they are looking to the Department for Education’s upcoming Send reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of home-to-school transport,” said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO. Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, expressed concern that the national conversation about children with Send has become focused on cost. “We have to put the needs of these youngsters first and ensure that the Send system and associated costs are sufficiently funded both now and in the future.” Bill Revans, Send spokesperson for the County Councils Network, said: “Councils in county areas are now spending more on school transport than they are on Sure Start centres, youth services and family services combined. This is unsustainable.” He called for “root and branch reform” of the Send system. “A key element of this should be enabling greater inclusion in mainstream schools so they can better cater for more Send pupils’ needs, allowing them to be taught locally and reducing the reliance on specialist placements whilst cutting transport costs for local authorities.” Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The schools white paper, now delayed to 2026, and forthcoming Send reforms must tackle these unsustainable expenditure rises and ensure that the children and young people who rely on this invaluable service continue to be supported in their access to education.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Work is already under way to make sure more children with Send can achieve and thrive at their local school alongside their peers – including investing £740m to create more specialist school places and increasing access to early support for speech and language needs. “We’ll set out the full schools white paper in the new year, building on the work we’ve already done to create a system that’s rooted in inclusion, where children receive high-quality support early on and at a school close to home.”",
