SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Halal tech: how Muslim-friendly websites and apps blossomed in 2024
DOMAIN: Technology

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
Amany Killawi made a breakup playlist every time she was dumped, three in all. The playlists, which feature songs such as Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know and Apologize by OneRepublic, would make good soundtracks to romantic splits, but that’s not what they were. The playlists came together after Killawi was told by three different banks and payment processors they would no longer work with LaunchGood, the crowdfunding platform for the Muslim community she co-founded. Stripe said its banking partner instructed the company to cut ties with LaunchGood after five years of working with the crowdfunding platform. Stripe also told the company it couldn’t be associated with any international humanitarian work in sanctioned jurisdictions like Syria – a prerequisite for a crowdfunding platform that caters to the Muslim community. Another bank told the company there were too many Muslim and Arabic names and figuring out if those names belonged to sanctioned individuals was difficult. “People don’t realize Muhammad is the most sanctioned name,” Killawi, who was the chief operating officer at LaunchGood, said. With each dismissal, it felt like LaunchGood was on the brink of collapse. “If you can’t accept payments, you can’t exist as a company,” she said. There were few existing options that gave Killawi and her co-founders the stability and reliability they sought. So they did what a growing number of Muslim founders have done since: create their own solution. To mitigate the impact on the business if and when another bank decided to stop working with LaunchGood, Killawi and her co-founders Chris Blauvelt and Omar Hamid made the decision to establish a network of payment providers and banks to work with. Their hope was that there would no longer be one point of failure that could tank their business. When they were dumped by a bank, which continued to happen over the years, they had several backups. Now, more than 10 years since its founding, LaunchGood has become a household name and has enabled its largely Muslim user base to raise nearly $700m. While the platform also hosts personal fundraisers, LaunchGood is better known for its emphasis on charitable giving and has enabled its users to set up an automated donation for every day of the holy month of Ramadan. It has become the primary gateway for many during Ramadan, during which many Muslims donate to charities on a daily basis. The site’s rise and the challenges it has faced are not an anomaly. The “halal” consumer market, which includes halal food, financial services and other goods and services that cater to Muslims, has grown to an estimated $2tn globally, according to research and advisory firm Dinar Standard. Yet a 2022 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims were more likely than other faith groups to have their accounts at banks and other US financial institutions closed, investigated or otherwise challenged, with businesses effectively d

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
And in the last year, as more in tech have become more active around the cause of Palestine, an infrastructure for pro-Palestinian companies has also materialized. Muslim and pro-Palestinian founders have begun to question the leadership at Stripe. Paul Biggar, who was kicked off the board of a company he founded after writing a pro-Palestinian blogpost, started an incubator called Tech for Palestine that aims to provide support for companies that are advocating in some way for Palestinian freedom. Yet a 2022 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims were more likely than other faith groups to have their accounts at banks and other US financial institutions closed, investigated or otherwise challenged, with businesses effectively denying themselves access to Muslim customers. She hopes to provide for Muslim businesses and charities what LaunchGood’s team had to hack together for themselves: a reliable payment system that doesn’t discriminate. So they did what a growing number of Muslim founders have done since: create their own solution. Despite the challenges Muslim-run and pro-Palestinian companies face, Killawi remains bullish about businesses that cater to the Muslim community.
