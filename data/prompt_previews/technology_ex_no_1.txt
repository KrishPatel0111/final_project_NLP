SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: ‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AI
DOMAIN: Technology

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
‘They called it an experiment aimed at younger audiences’ Mateusz Demski, 31, journalist, Kraków, Poland I’ve been a freelance journalist for 10 years, usually writing for magazines and websites about cinema. I presented a morning show on Radio Kraków twice a week for about two years. It was only one part of my work, but I really enjoyed it. It was about culture and cinema, and featured a range of people, from artists to activists. I remember interviewing Ukrainians about the Russian invasion for the first programme I presented, back in 2022. I was let go in August 2024, alongside a dozen co-workers who were also part-time. We were told the radio station was having financial problems. I was relatively OK with it, as I had other income streams. But a few months later I heard that Radio Kraków was launching programmes hosted by three AI characters. Each had AI-generated photographs, a biography and a specific personality. They called it an “experiment” aimed at younger audiences. One of the first shows they did was a live “interview” with Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, winner of the 1996 Nobel prize for literature, who had died 12 years earlier. What are the ethics of using the likeness of a dead person? Szymborska is a symbol of Polish intellectual culture, so it caused outrage. I couldn’t understand it: radio is created by people for other people. We cannot replace our experiences, emotions or voices with avatars. One of my colleagues who was laid off is queer. One of the new AI avatars was called Alex, a non-binary student and a “specialist” in queer subjects. In Poland, we are still fighting for queer rights, and as journalists it’s incumbent on us to have real representation when reporting on this. For my colleague and the LGBTQ+ community, it was shocking and damaging to hear their lived experience and knowledge being imitated by AI. Some of us who had been laid off started a petition against the station, calling for regulation and to get the AI shows taken off air. We got tens of thousands of people to sign – actors, journalists, artists, but also listeners. Hundreds of young people didn’t want to listen to an AI show. The station has since scrapped the avatars, largely because of the success of our campaign. It’s now student-run. The station claim this is about offering mentorship, but it’s also a cheaper alternative to hiring qualified journalists. I guess it’s better than AI, though. There are still no clear regulations covering its use in Poland. I’m not campaigning for regulation because I lost my job to AI: I’m campaigning because I’m worried about the ethics of all of this; about misinformation and deceiving listeners.I’m a realist – I’m not completely against AI. I think it can be used responsibly to do the boring bits of our job. But we can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence. * * * ‘Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced’ Lina Mei

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Even the Indonesian government is using AI art: they recently released a video promoting a scheme that provides free lunches for students. I first learned about generative AI a few years ago, watching a YouTuber introduce viewers to the software Midjourney, which generates images based on prompts. The effect of generative AI in my industry is something I’ve felt personally. One client told me straight out that they have started using generative AI for their voices because it’s faster. When generative AI came along, the company was very vocal about using it as a tool to help clients get creative. Even before AI tools arrived, it wasn’t easy. One of the main platforms freelance artists use to get work recently launched a campaign called “Nobody cares if you use AI”, encouraging clients and artists to embrace AI tools.
