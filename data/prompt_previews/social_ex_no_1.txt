SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Threats, fear and hope as Mumbai slum dwellers await the bulldozers
DOMAIN: Social

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
For months, the threatening phone calls kept coming. First, allegedly from an ex-police officer and a retired army general, and then from the police themselves. Finally, Mohammad Khurshid Shaikh claims, he was summoned to the police station and told clearly: keep quiet or there will be real trouble for you. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. “The culture and ecosystem of Dharavi is like nowhere else in the world,” says Shaikh. “But they want to destroy our community and stop us speaking out.” The dank gullies of Dharavi sit in stark contrast to the soaring skyscrapers and Bollywood penthouses that loom over the settlement. Homes are built haphazardly and often without proper sanitation, unregulated industries emit toxic smoke and the air is filled with the suffocating smell of open sewers. To some, the promise of Dharavi transformed into a glistening neighbourhood of luxury high-rises, neat parks, shiny shopping centres and homes with two toilets is an aspirational dream come true. “We don’t have proper healthcare, roads or drainage and there’s nowhere for children to play,” says A Selvin Nadar, 56, a chai seller who migrated from Tamil Nadu in 1982. “The only way is to tear it all down and build us new homes.” But others, such as Shaikh, are resisting. None deny that Dharavi, long neglected as an illegal encroachment, is in stark need of investment and development. Yet they fear that this plan – absent of public consultation – is one that will turn a piece of prime Mumbai real estate into a playground for the rich, forcing out the lower-caste, migrant communities who have been there since the late 1800s. It was these shunned, displaced people who built up the empty marshland into a widely studied marvel of self-reliance and economic productivity, whose output is valued at between $1bn and $2bn a year, making it one of the world’s largest informal economies. Of the roughly 1 million residents living in the dense 220-hectare (2.2 sq km) area, fewer than half will be eligible for new homes in the development, which is projected to take seven years to complete. Others will be moved to wastelands and salt plains on the far outskirts of the city, threatening to fragment a generations-old community. Some will not get homes at all. Those allowed to remain in Dharavi will be given apartments in tower blocks, a significant rupture from the organic, communal way of living and working that has sustained Dharavi for so long. Industries from tailoring to pottery and recycling are likely to shrink in number and be moved to a designated “commercial zone” far from people’s residences. For those such as Shaikh, a leather artisan and third generation of his family to live in Dharavi, the plan presents an existential threat. His rickety, three-storey workshop makes leather coats – sharp blazers

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Kalyankar said the terms of rehabilitation for Dharavi residents were “much more generous” than other slum projects in Mumbai. Mahendra Kalyankar, the government chief executive of the Dharavi project, denied that the development would ostracise and fragment the community and said he had not heard of residents facing pressure. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. Gangawane confirmed to the Guardian he was working as an intelligence officer for Adani Group in Dharavi but denied any threats or coercion and said those who made the allegations had “malicious intentions”. Dharavi can become a central business district if developed properly and it will be a paradise on earth for residents. A spokesperson for Navbharat Mega Developers Private Limited, the Adani-government entity handling Dharavi, said all accusations of intimidation and harassment were “unfounded” and that their survey had been done “with complete fairness and transparency”. Harassment and intimidation In the government offices nearby, an illustrated mock-up of the Dharavi project depicts a very different vision for the future.
