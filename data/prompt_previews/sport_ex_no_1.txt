SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Former West Coast player Mitch Brown becomes first AFL player to come out as bisexual
DOMAIN: Sport

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
Mitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen. The 36-year-old played 94 matches for West Coast in a career that ended in 2016. He identifies as a bisexual man and is in a long-term relationship with a woman. Brown said it would have been difficult had he spoken publicly during his playing career, but was motivated to help change the culture within the sport. “Maybe a second person [comes out], and then the third…,” he told The Daily Aus. “You may be playing with someone who’s in the queer community. Empathy is powerful.” Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. But suspensions have been unable to address the root causes of the game’s struggle to accept diversity among its players. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown said. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter The news was widely welcomed on social media. In addition to messages from fans and supporters, the AFL Players’ Association described the post as “powerful” and the GWS Giants’ account responded with a heart emoji. Pride Cup CEO Hayley Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+ communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “To be honest, I did not think I would ever see the day when either an ex or current AFL men’s player would come out,” she said. “I felt like we were so far away from this, which is really, really exciting, that someone has done it. It shouldn’t take courage to tell the world who you are, but it is extremely courageous from Mitch. “In the light of what the community went through last week, I thought that it’s even more brave that he decided to do it around this time and to speak up about his experiences.” Brown grew up in Ballarat and was drafted into the AFL with pick 16 in 2006. The defender debuted the following year and spent a decade in the competition before playing his final game at age 27, an elimination final against the Western Bulldogs. “I got to the end of my career and I was asked to play on for a couple more years, and I was over it. I was done,” he said. “I craved talking to someone and not being judged. I craved the ability to choose who I wanted to be around, rather than to fit into a team.” He said he had “buried” questions about his own sexuality due to the “hyper-masculine” environment, and that slurs were so constant they “just became part of the normal conversation”. “There have been so many times in my life I’ve seen things or heard things and not said anything … in fear of people thinking I was gay or bisexual.” Brown said he empathises with those currently playing, and it is easier for him as a past player to speak up. “I don’t have to

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Pride Cup CEO Hayley Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+ communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “I’m hopeful this could mean that Mitch’s story might have a bigger impact than other players who’ve come out, because he’s a respected AFL player, an insider, talking about the problems in the game. Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown said. AFL CEO Andrew Dillon acknowledged Brown’s courage in sharing his story and how important the moment was for the game. Mitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen. We haven’t heard that kind of direct criticism before from other players who have come out, including in rugby union and also football in Australia, and so this is an important turning point.
