SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Freedom and joy: Rugby World Cup’s quirky quality sets it apart from the pack
DOMAIN: Sport

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
I have a friend who rejects the notion of “guilty pleasures”. There is, she argues, plenty of real and justified guilt in the world, without co-opting it to our choice of trash TV or an unkickable penchant for romantasy novels. She’s a helpful touchstone when I hear myself trying to justify the silly superhero film I went to see at the cinema on the basis that it might have carried an underlying anti-fascist message (if you squinted hard enough at the screen). My friend will sigh kindly and then remind me: sometimes it’s OK just to enjoy things. It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer. Ask a football fan if they enjoyed themselves at the match they just paid a decent whack to see, and there’s a better-than-even chance they will tell you no. If it was a close match, they will have been too anxious to have fun; if they lost they will be mourning their defeat. Even if their own side ran rampant, you can find them complaining about the lack of challenge or jeopardy. We are, as fans, especially averse to one-sided games, which can feel anything from a deflationary disappointment to a waste of everybody’s time. This is why the current Women’s Rugby World Cup is such a curious phenomenon. The tournament has been one of largely lopsided scorelines, from the group stages to the quarter-finals. Only five of the 28 fixtures have been decided by fewer than 14 points, and more than half were won by more than 40 – at least six scores. And yet there remains a profound and unanimous pleasure to be had across the entire affair: it’s hard to find anyone that’s watching along and not enjoying it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). Meanwhile the action on the pitch has delivered flair and fascination, even on days when the rain has lashed down until the ball is butter and the scrums steam like suet pudding. The match-ups may be uneven but the power and athleticism on display on all sides of the pitch have been mesmerising. Sure, the host nation’s dominance is a natural mood enhancer. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. That’s only part of the picture, however. It doesn’t encompass the joyful embrace of The Kid, New Zealand’s 18-year-old top try-scorer Braxton Sorensen-McGee (whose daring dashes down the wing could well knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles if the two sides meet). It can’t account for the bipartisan cheer when Spain, 54-3 d

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Their fast-growing fanbase, many of whom have only discovered the sport in the past couple of years, do not show up to games with the typical baggage: decades of disappointment, crusted-over anger, inherited and inexplicably toxic rivalries. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. Other sports – and more pertinently their investors – will be analysing this fan engagement and wondering how to replicate it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. It is, of course, a marketing tactic as much as a rallying cry, but it came directly from team conversations and reflects something quite true about the women’s rugby community, that is a place where people are for each other, not against them. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer.
