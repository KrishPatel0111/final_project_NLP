Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Church of Norway says sorry to LGBTQ+ people for ‘shame, great harm and pain’ 
DOMAIN: Social

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
Against a backdrop of red stage curtains at one of Oslo’s most prominent LGBTQ+ spaces, the Church of Norway apologised for the discrimination and harm it had inflicted. “The church in Norway has caused LGBTQ+ people shame, great harm and pain,” the presiding bishop, Olav Fykse Tveit, said on Thursday. “This should never have happened and that is why I apologise today.” The “discrimination, unequal treatment and harassment” had caused some to lose their faith, Tveit acknowledged. A church service at Oslo Cathedral was scheduled to follow his apology. The apology took place at the London Pub, one of two bars targeted in the 2022 shooting that killed two people and left nine seriously injured during Oslo’s Pride celebrations. A Norwegian of Iranian origin, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for the killings. Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church. In the 1950s, the church’s bishops described gay people as a “social danger of global proportions”. But as Norwegian society became increasingly liberal, becoming the second in the world to allow same-sex registered partnerships in 1993 and in 2009 the first Scandinavian country to allow same-sex marriage, the church slowly followed. In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able to marry in church since 2017. In 2023, Tveit participated in Oslo’s Pride parade in what was described as a first for the church. Thursday’s apology was met with a mixed reaction. The head of a network of Christian lesbians in Norway, Hanne Marie Pedersen-Eriksen, herself a gay pastor, described it as “an important reparation” and a moment that “finally marked the end of a dark chapter in the church’s history”. For Stephen Adom, the head of Norway’s Association for Gender and Sexual Diversity, the apology was “strong and important” but had come “too late for those among us who died of Aids … with hearts filled with anguish because the church considered the epidemic to be God’s punishment”. Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the Church of England apologised for what it described as its “shameful” treatment, though it continues to refuse to allow same-sex marriages in church. Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last year apologised for its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman. Earlier this year, the United Church of Canada offered an apology to two spirit and LGBTQIA+ communities, describing it as a reaffirmation of the church’s “commitment to radical hospitality and full inclusion” in all aspects of church li

ARTICLE TITLE: Guyana in turmoil after opposition leader arrested and faces US extradition
DOMAIN: Social

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power. Azruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government. Facing 11 charges in a Florida court – including money laundering, bribery and tax evasion – they were released later the same day after posting bail of 150,000 Guyanese dollars each (about £547 or $719.95), but must report to the court weekly and will face a new hearing on Monday. Mohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media. Mohabir Anil Nandlall, Guyana’s attorney general, said the case was a “legal obligation” arising from the country’s international commitments – a 1931 extradition treaty between the UK and the US remains in force in Guyana, which became independent from Britain in 1966. The case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita. “It’s a situation where the status quo in Guyana is being challenged,” said Peter Wickham, a political scientist and director of a polling company in the Caribbean. Mohamed founded a party and announced his candidacy just three months before the presidential election, breaking with the country’s long-standing two-party system that has traditionally pitted the president’s PPP/C, broadly backed by the Indo-Guyanese population, against the APNU, generally supported by Afro-Guyanese voters. Mohamed urged Guyanese to reject “tribal voting” and, running on a populist, anti-establishment platform, promised to push for renegotiation of the oil deal – despite the country’s newly discovered oil wealth, more than half of its population still lives in poverty. “He hoped to become a kind of balance of power for whoever won the election, but the result ended up being better than he expected,” Wickham said. The incumbent Ali won, and his party secured 36 of the 65 seats in congress. But unlike in previous elections, it was not the APNU that emerged as the main opposition force – it won only 12 seats – but Mohamed’s party, with 16. Last Monday, three days after Mohamed was arrested and released on bail, he was sworn in alongside the rest of the new congress. He arrived in the Lamborghini at the centre of an alleged mail fraud case against him, in which he is accused of submitting a false $75,300 invoice for a vehicle said

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
In addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition. Azruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government. Mohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media. Although the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024. The case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita. Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power.

ARTICLE TITLE: Threats, fear and hope as Mumbai slum dwellers await the bulldozers
DOMAIN: Social

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
For months, the threatening phone calls kept coming. First, allegedly from an ex-police officer and a retired army general, and then from the police themselves. Finally, Mohammad Khurshid Shaikh claims, he was summoned to the police station and told clearly: keep quiet or there will be real trouble for you. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. “The culture and ecosystem of Dharavi is like nowhere else in the world,” says Shaikh. “But they want to destroy our community and stop us speaking out.” The dank gullies of Dharavi sit in stark contrast to the soaring skyscrapers and Bollywood penthouses that loom over the settlement. Homes are built haphazardly and often without proper sanitation, unregulated industries emit toxic smoke and the air is filled with the suffocating smell of open sewers. To some, the promise of Dharavi transformed into a glistening neighbourhood of luxury high-rises, neat parks, shiny shopping centres and homes with two toilets is an aspirational dream come true. “We don’t have proper healthcare, roads or drainage and there’s nowhere for children to play,” says A Selvin Nadar, 56, a chai seller who migrated from Tamil Nadu in 1982. “The only way is to tear it all down and build us new homes.” But others, such as Shaikh, are resisting. None deny that Dharavi, long neglected as an illegal encroachment, is in stark need of investment and development. Yet they fear that this plan – absent of public consultation – is one that will turn a piece of prime Mumbai real estate into a playground for the rich, forcing out the lower-caste, migrant communities who have been there since the late 1800s. It was these shunned, displaced people who built up the empty marshland into a widely studied marvel of self-reliance and economic productivity, whose output is valued at between $1bn and $2bn a year, making it one of the world’s largest informal economies. Of the roughly 1 million residents living in the dense 220-hectare (2.2 sq km) area, fewer than half will be eligible for new homes in the development, which is projected to take seven years to complete. Others will be moved to wastelands and salt plains on the far outskirts of the city, threatening to fragment a generations-old community. Some will not get homes at all. Those allowed to remain in Dharavi will be given apartments in tower blocks, a significant rupture from the organic, communal way of living and working that has sustained Dharavi for so long. Industries from tailoring to pottery and recycling are likely to shrink in number and be moved to a designated “commercial zone” far from people’s residences. For those such as Shaikh, a leather artisan and third generation of his family to live in Dharavi, the plan presents an existential threat. His rickety, three-storey workshop makes leather coats – sharp blazers

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Kalyankar said the terms of rehabilitation for Dharavi residents were “much more generous” than other slum projects in Mumbai. Mahendra Kalyankar, the government chief executive of the Dharavi project, denied that the development would ostracise and fragment the community and said he had not heard of residents facing pressure. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. Gangawane confirmed to the Guardian he was working as an intelligence officer for Adani Group in Dharavi but denied any threats or coercion and said those who made the allegations had “malicious intentions”. Dharavi can become a central business district if developed properly and it will be a paradise on earth for residents. A spokesperson for Navbharat Mega Developers Private Limited, the Adani-government entity handling Dharavi, said all accusations of intimidation and harassment were “unfounded” and that their survey had been done “with complete fairness and transparency”. Harassment and intimidation In the government offices nearby, an illustrated mock-up of the Dharavi project depicts a very different vision for the future.
