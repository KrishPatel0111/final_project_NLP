SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Jane Plastow obituary
DOMAIN: Educational

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
Jane Plastow, who has died of cancer aged 66, was an academic and theatre-maker based at the University of Leeds who made invaluable contributions to the fields of community-based theatre, African studies and global development. Jane led the Centre for African Studies at Leeds from 2004 to 2014, overseeing the innovative theatre and global development MA. In 2006 she was made professor of African theatre, with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka attending her inaugural lecture. A pivotal point in Jane’s career came in the 1990s with her long-term projects with Eritrean artists and educators in the aftermath of the war of independence. Most recently, Jane had a longstanding collaboration with We Are Walukuba, a community group in Jinja, Uganda. Over a decade, Jane and collaborators challenged the dominant short-term and message-based conventions of theatre for development by co-creating new approaches to challenge existing social issues. These long-term dialogical forms of artistic engagement promoted grassroots knowledge and discussion between community members and wider stakeholders. Her experience led to the publication of her two-volume A History of East African Theatre (2020, 2021), followed by Community-Based Arts, Research and Activism in Uganda: We Are Walukuba (2025), and her forthcoming monograph Somali Musical Theatre (2026). Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, she was the daughter of Mary (nee Luckett), a legal secretary, and Gerald Plastow, who worked in local government. After attending Tunbridge Wells Girls’ grammar school, Jane completed a BA in English at the University of Manchester in 1981. She then travelled to Africa for the first time, undertaking a teaching post in the Gambia. This job would mark the beginning of a 44-year collaborative relationship with African artists, activists and educators traversing many countries including Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Somaliland, Djibouti and Zimbabwe. After her time in the Gambia, Jane became a lecturer at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, for three years. She then completed an MPhil and a PhD at Manchester, before moving to the Ulster University at Coleraine in 1991 to lecture in theatre studies, and then to Leeds in 1994. Jane acted as PhD supervisor for many students, many of whom went on to hold senior positions at leading African universities. In her years after her cancer diagnosis, Jane became interested in growing authoritarianism in the UK when her son, Will, was arrested for pro-Palestinian activism. Her uncompleted final book, provisionally titled Keir Starmer’s Political Prisoners, consisted of interviews with British political prisoners, and highlighted the increasingly severe state crackdown on dissent in the UK. Jane was a collaborator who truly believed, inhabited and realised the political power of the arts. She had an unrelenting and unstoppable energy and an enormous sense of fun. She is survived by Will, her brother, John, and sisters Beverley and Caroline.

ARTICLE TITLE: Sacking of Christian school worker over posts about LGBTQ+ lessons unlawful, court rules
DOMAIN: Educational

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to youn

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”.
