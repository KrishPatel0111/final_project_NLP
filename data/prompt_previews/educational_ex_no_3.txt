SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Trump and Project 2025 are attacking the Department of Education. How might they reshape US schools?
DOMAIN: Educational

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
Donald Trump wants to shut down the US Department of Education, saying at recent rallies that it should be disbanded to “move everything back to the states where it belongs”. The idea of dismantling the education department has become increasingly mainstream, though it’s nearly as old as the department itself, which was created by Congress as a cabinet-level agency in 1979. Trump made similar promises on the 2016 campaign trail to either cut or hobble the department. Eliminating it would require Congress to act, which could be an impossible feat, though several of Trump and his allies’ policy goals on education could be accomplished through presidential actions. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing manifesto for a potential incoming Trump administration, lays out how dismantling the federal education department would work, leaving behind, if anything, a husk focused solely as a “statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states”, writes Lindsey Burke, the author of the education chapter and leader of Heritage’s education policy center. The department’s elimination is one of many goals contained in the extensive conservative playbook that will inform a second Trump term. Project 2025 calls for privatizing education and driving out any programs related to LGBTQ+ youth or diversity. “This playbook actually goes into detail that we’ve never seen before,” said Weadé James, senior director for K-12 policy at the Center for American Progress. It would have profound implications on civil rights, school funding and students’ progress – not to mention on the fate of public schools, she said. “The striking part about all of this, too, is the Department of Education is actually the smallest of any cabinet-level agency. There are only a little over 4,000 employees within the department,” James said. “So we need to be talking about investing in the department, expanding the capacity of the department to do the work that it is designed to do.” Burke, the Heritage author , declined a request for an interview. In a statement, the Heritage Foundation said that while it seeks to offer recommendations to the “next conservative president”, it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign”. And while Trump’s campaign has tried to distance the candidate from Project 2025, saying he has his own agenda to carry out, the former president and the project are aligned on much of their education plans. During a speech to a “faith and freedom” conference this week, Trump railed against education rankings and spending, saying the US performs poorly despite money spent on students. Some states could do better without federal intervention, he said. “We’ll cut our budget in half and not everybody’s going to be great,” he said. “I mean, [California governor] Gavin Newsom will not do a good job with education, so I don’t expect that out of him. And I don’t expect it out of certain other people … But many of the states, I would say 40 of the 50 stat

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Trump tells voters on his campaign site a few ways he would manage education: Cut federal funding for schools that are “pushing critical race theory or gender ideology on our children” and open civil rights investigations into them for race-based discrimination. School funding fundamentally changed Education is primarily funded and overseen by state and local authorities in the US, but the federal government funds some elements of education and sets certain policies, which are then implemented locally. Beyond these major funding changes, the project – and Trump – both want to see expansions of school choice, like voucher programs that allow students to use money that would otherwise fund their seats at public schools to attend a private ones. The project proposes ridding education programs of any “gender ideology and critical race theory”, like a “non-binary” category in data collection or the ability of trans youth to participate in sports aligned with their gender. Instead of directing how funds should be used, it generally says states should be given money with no strings attached to spend on “any lawful education purpose under state law”. The project also wants what remains of the Department of Education to gather data and report on programs or grants that spread “DEI/CRT/gender ideology”, how “family structure” affects student achievement, how pandemic aid funds were spent and how much money goes directly into the classroom from federal grant programs. Eliminating it would require Congress to act, which could be an impossible feat, though several of Trump and his allies’ policy goals on education could be accomplished through presidential actions.

ARTICLE TITLE: UK students urged to mind terror laws before 7 October pro-Palestine protests
DOMAIN: Educational

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
University leaders have cautioned students planning to take part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations to coincide with the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, warning them that “expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence”. Up to 10 events – variously described as vigils, rallies and debates – are thought to have been planned on or near campuses on Tuesday, including an “inter-university” march in London, involving students and staff from several London institutions. It will be the second anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead, many more injured or kidnapped and sparked the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 65,000 people. Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-chancellors and acts as the voice of the sector, wrote to members last week after the attack on Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, warning that the anniversary was a “potential flashpoint” and urging members to “review security arrangements”. Vivienne Stern, the UUK’s chief executive, said: “While universities must be places where contentious views can be expressed, and while universities have a legal duty to uphold free speech, we urge students and staff participating in protests to remember that 7 October is the anniversary of an atrocious attack on innocent people, and that expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence.” Details of the London march are posted on Instagram under the banner headline: “Inter-university march. Two years of genocide and our institutions remain complicit.” It calls for a walkout of classes at 2pm, with the route taking in King’s College London (KCL), the London School of Economics, University College London and finishing at SOAS. Other 7 October events have been advertised at the University of Sheffield, where the Revolutionary Communist party is staging a “rally for Palestine”, and Strathclyde University, where the Palestine Solidarity Society is staging a “Protest 4 Palestine”, while KCL Students for Justice for Palestine has an evening of debate and discussion called “Why it didn’t start on October 7th”. Stern said there has been a “deeply concerning” rise in antisemitic incidents in the last two years and the “UUK has worked closely with university leaders to tackle this”. She urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents. “We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,” she added. Louis Danker, the president of the Union of Jewish Students, said: “We respect the right to protest and the importance of free speech within the law. There are 365 days in the year and on one of them – 7 October – Jewish students seek the space to mourn their loved ones murdered in southern Israel. “Moreover, marking ‘two years of resistance’ on 7 Oct

She urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents. “We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,” she added. Vivienne Stern, the UUK’s chief executive, said: “While universities must be places where contentious views can be expressed, and while universities have a legal duty to uphold free speech, we urge students and staff participating in protests to remember that 7 October is the anniversary of an atrocious attack on innocent people, and that expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence.” There are 365 days in the year and on one of them – 7 October – Jewish students seek the space to mourn their loved ones murdered in southern Israel. Writing in the Times, the prime minister said: “Let me just spell that out for a moment: people on our streets calling for the murder of Jewish people they have never even met, for something they are not responsible for. And that’s before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.” The demonstration went ahead despite Starmer calling on protesters to call it off to “respect the grief of British Jews”, while Jewish leaders described the action as “phenomenally tone deaf” after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue.

ARTICLE TITLE: Sacking of Christian school worker over posts about LGBTQ+ lessons unlawful, court rules
DOMAIN: Educational

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to youn

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”.
