SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Threats, fear and hope as Mumbai slum dwellers await the bulldozers
DOMAIN: Social

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
For months, the threatening phone calls kept coming. First, allegedly from an ex-police officer and a retired army general, and then from the police themselves. Finally, Mohammad Khurshid Shaikh claims, he was summoned to the police station and told clearly: keep quiet or there will be real trouble for you. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. “The culture and ecosystem of Dharavi is like nowhere else in the world,” says Shaikh. “But they want to destroy our community and stop us speaking out.” The dank gullies of Dharavi sit in stark contrast to the soaring skyscrapers and Bollywood penthouses that loom over the settlement. Homes are built haphazardly and often without proper sanitation, unregulated industries emit toxic smoke and the air is filled with the suffocating smell of open sewers. To some, the promise of Dharavi transformed into a glistening neighbourhood of luxury high-rises, neat parks, shiny shopping centres and homes with two toilets is an aspirational dream come true. “We don’t have proper healthcare, roads or drainage and there’s nowhere for children to play,” says A Selvin Nadar, 56, a chai seller who migrated from Tamil Nadu in 1982. “The only way is to tear it all down and build us new homes.” But others, such as Shaikh, are resisting. None deny that Dharavi, long neglected as an illegal encroachment, is in stark need of investment and development. Yet they fear that this plan – absent of public consultation – is one that will turn a piece of prime Mumbai real estate into a playground for the rich, forcing out the lower-caste, migrant communities who have been there since the late 1800s. It was these shunned, displaced people who built up the empty marshland into a widely studied marvel of self-reliance and economic productivity, whose output is valued at between $1bn and $2bn a year, making it one of the world’s largest informal economies. Of the roughly 1 million residents living in the dense 220-hectare (2.2 sq km) area, fewer than half will be eligible for new homes in the development, which is projected to take seven years to complete. Others will be moved to wastelands and salt plains on the far outskirts of the city, threatening to fragment a generations-old community. Some will not get homes at all. Those allowed to remain in Dharavi will be given apartments in tower blocks, a significant rupture from the organic, communal way of living and working that has sustained Dharavi for so long. Industries from tailoring to pottery and recycling are likely to shrink in number and be moved to a designated “commercial zone” far from people’s residences. For those such as Shaikh, a leather artisan and third generation of his family to live in Dharavi, the plan presents an existential threat. His rickety, three-storey workshop makes leather coats – sharp blazers

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Kalyankar said the terms of rehabilitation for Dharavi residents were “much more generous” than other slum projects in Mumbai. Mahendra Kalyankar, the government chief executive of the Dharavi project, denied that the development would ostracise and fragment the community and said he had not heard of residents facing pressure. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. Gangawane confirmed to the Guardian he was working as an intelligence officer for Adani Group in Dharavi but denied any threats or coercion and said those who made the allegations had “malicious intentions”. Dharavi can become a central business district if developed properly and it will be a paradise on earth for residents. A spokesperson for Navbharat Mega Developers Private Limited, the Adani-government entity handling Dharavi, said all accusations of intimidation and harassment were “unfounded” and that their survey had been done “with complete fairness and transparency”. Harassment and intimidation In the government offices nearby, an illustrated mock-up of the Dharavi project depicts a very different vision for the future.

ARTICLE TITLE: Spirituality isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice that helps make sense of an incomprehensible world
DOMAIN: Social

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
When I was leaving London for Melbourne, my eldest sister-in-law told her kids not to forget the “tradition” – to throw a bowl of water behind me as I stepped out the door. Just a small splash on the ground, a gesture older than borders. “La har azaab po aman se,” she whispered in Pashto under her breath – may all hardship stay away from you. The little ones giggled and waved their goodbyes as they spilled the water, somewhere between shy and amused. My mother used to do this too, back in Afghanistan. Every time I left for a journey, especially international ones, she’d quietly follow me to the gate with a bowl of water, whispering prayers I couldn’t always hear. But this moment, between two western cities, with children growing up in a world so far from where that habit began, felt different. It was softer. Bittersweet. Like watching an old song being hummed in a new language. I grew up between Kabul and Karachi; two cities that always felt like they were on the edge of something. One broken by war, the other always just holding itself together amid all sorts of hardships of a city outgrowing itself but starved of resources and infrastructure. In both, I learned that people survive not just through faith but through the small things they do when no one’s watching; the quiet rituals and little beliefs that live in everyday life. They’re not loud, not official. But they’re full of love and hope. I saw it all around me. In the way my grandmother would suggest a black cloth by the door after someone recovered from illness or we bought something “precious” – to keep the evil eye away. In the way my aunt would burn esfand herb above her children in a pot when they came home from a wedding or party looking too beautiful and getting too much attention. In the way my other sister-in-law would put a tiny black dot behind her baby’s ear when he smiled too much – just to hide some of that beauty from the world. “People are not very nice and too much goodness invites jealousy and negativity,” she’d say. “It’s better to be a little hidden.” Drawing on my own encounters, I’ve come to see how these seemingly small gestures – the fragrant smoke of esfand to lift heaviness, the rhythmic pull of qawwali, the quiet assurance of a taweez tied around a wrist – hold more than superstition. They carry virtues: grounding, comfort and a deep sense of protection. None of these things were in any book of religion. No one ever sat down and taught them. They were just picked up, like pebbles from the ground, passed from women to girls, from grandmothers to mothers to daughters – and sometimes to sons who were paying attention. Even the most religious people I know – people who prayed five times a day, who fasted every Ramadan, who could quote the Qur’an by heart – still do these little things. They didn’t see them as separate or wrong. Just part of faith and tradition woven together into everyday life, to feel safe and at peace. When I moved to Melbourne, I carried some of t

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Especially back home where things could change overnight, where life was unpredictable, where people had lost so much. In both, I learned that people survive not just through faith but through the small things they do when no one’s watching; the quiet rituals and little beliefs that live in everyday life. “La har azaab po aman se,” she whispered in Pashto under her breath – may all hardship stay away from you. People used to tie little strips of cloth to its branches; one for each prayer they made. Just part of faith and tradition woven together into everyday life, to feel safe and at peace. They are threads that connect us to our past, whispers of love carried across generations and subtle ways of finding peace in a world that so often feels chaotic. Even the most religious people I know – people who prayed five times a day, who fasted every Ramadan, who could quote the Qur’an by heart – still do these little things.
