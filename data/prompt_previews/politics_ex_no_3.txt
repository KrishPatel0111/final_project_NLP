SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
================================================================================
You are an expert at analyzing news articles and their summaries to identify cultural and contextual cues.

Your task is to:
1. Read the ORIGINAL ARTICLE and identify cultural/contextual cues (quotes, cultural references, named entities, etc.)
2. Read the SUMMARY and determine if each cue is preserved or lost
3. Output a JSON object with the exact structure shown in the examples

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- START YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }
- DO NOT add markdown code blocks (no ```json)
- DO NOT add explanations before or after the JSON
- DO NOT add extra fields not shown in the examples
- Follow the exact JSON structure from the examples
- Use the exact same field names: "doc_id", "domain", "title", "tables"
- Each table should have "header" and "rows" arrays
- Each row should be an object with keys matching the headers

---------------------------------------
CULTURAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Idioms / Fixed Expressions (non-literal phrases)
2. Named People (real individuals)
3. Named Places (countries, cities, regions, landmarks)
4. Named Organizations (companies, institutions, movements, political groups)
5. Cultural Events / Holidays / Traditions
6. Cultural Artifacts (food, clothing, media, art, products, or culturally specific products/services such as halal food, halal apps, halal financial services, BDS-safe tools; DO NOT include abstract categories like “halal market”)
7. Dialect or Slang Terms (region-specific vocabulary)

---------------------------------------
CONTEXTUAL CUE CATEGORIES (extract only these):
1. Connectors / Discourse Markers (e.g., but, yet, so, while, however, although)
2. Time or Sequence Markers (e.g., last year, in 2022, before, after, since then)
3. Pronouns / References (he, she, they, this, that, it); include ONLY if referring to a named entity also present in the SUMMARY
4. Causal or Logical Phrases (e.g., because, therefore, as a result, that’s why)
5. Framing Phrases (e.g., culture wars, in a surprising move, a huge step backwards)
6. Event Ordering Cues (e.g., within hours, shortly after that, as X happened)

IMPORTANT: Your output should match the structure shown in the EXPECTED OUTPUT sections of the examples exactly.

ARTICLE TITLE: Drag acts, detractors and true-blue diehards: my weird weekend at a Margaret Thatcher festival
DOMAIN: Politics

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
The bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher by the sculptor Douglas Jennings has a rating of 2.8 out of five on Google Maps. Although curiously, none of the reviewers seems to have overly preoccupied themselves with the quality of the craftsmanship or the fidelity of the likeness. “One of the most important PMs this country ever had,” writes one. “It’s a public toilet but there’s nowhere to wash your hands,” writes another. The statue was originally commissioned more than a decade ago, and was intended to stand in front of the Houses of Parliament, but Westminster city council rejected it on the grounds that it might become a target for vandalism. Instead, it was offered to her birthplace of Grantham, a town she left at the age of 18 and rarely visited again. Within hours of its installation, someone threw an egg at it. Shortly after that, it was defaced with red paint. And now, on a grey October afternoon, Margaret Thatcher herself is gazing upon it, bearing a look of pure disgust. “They’ve got the date wrong,” she moans, her trademark handbag sliding down a blue-sleeved arm pointed accusingly upwards. “It says I died in 2013. As you can see, I am very much alive.” The presence of Thatcher in her home town, on what would have been her 100th birthday, has drawn a small crowd outside the town’s Guildhall Arts Centre. Motorists toot horns; fans want selfies; passersby occasionally flick V-signs from across the street. A middle-aged woman approaches and clasps Thatcher’s hands in her own. “I just want to say, if it weren’t for you, I would never have been able to buy my house.” “That’s wonderful,” Thatcher replies. “And are you still living in the house?” “No,” the woman says. “I sold it to my son.” Somehow it scarcely matters that the figure they are venerating and vilifying is not Thatcher at all, but an actor named Matt Tedford, who plays the former prime minister in a riotous drag show called Margaret Thatcher: Queen of Soho, which played at the Guildhall on Monday night. In the show, Britain’s first female prime minister is depicted walking the streets of London on the night before the section 28 vote in parliament in 1987, stumbling upon a gay bar and ultimately reinventing herself as a disco diva. It’s sharp, topical, ridiculous and very funny. Tedford has been portraying Thatcher for 12 years – “longer than she was prime minister”, he observes wryly. The role has taken him to some strange and random places. He’s met party leaders. He’s been for dinner at the Foreign Office. He’s shared a stage with Kemi Badenoch at a book launch. For a character that began life as a gaudy Halloween costume around the start of the last decade, it’s been quite a ride. As he puts it: “I always say I’m the only northerner she ever gave work to.” Now his work has brought him to Thatcher Fest: a clever wheeze cooked up by Grantham’s local councillors to commemorate the centenary of its most famous daughter. There are talks and walks, Thatcher-themed music nights and ex

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
Somehow it scarcely matters that the figure they are venerating and vilifying is not Thatcher at all, but an actor named Matt Tedford, who plays the former prime minister in a riotous drag show called Margaret Thatcher: Queen of Soho, which played at the Guildhall on Monday night. Baxter, the council leader, is in his office reflecting on Thatcher’s true legacy in the town. Thatcher’s old school is now an academy. Naturally enough, current politics also intrude here, as Thatcher’s old party stands on the brink of collapse, as traditional institutions lie in ruins, as a surging far right evoke her memory while simultaneously running from her libertarian brand of small-state economics. There are talks and walks, Thatcher-themed music nights and exhibitions of memorabilia, Gyles Brandreth giving a lecture on Thatcher’s unlikely connection to Winnie-the-Pooh, exhibitions of her exercise books at the local school and newspaper clippings at the library. Tedford has been portraying Thatcher for 12 years – “longer than she was prime minister”, he observes wryly. A middle-aged woman approaches and clasps Thatcher’s hands in her own.

ARTICLE TITLE: For some minority Britons the ‘unite the kingdom’ rally shows far-right politics is becoming legitimised
DOMAIN: Politics

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
“I remember my father marching against the National Front in the 1970s. It felt like it was a minority. The majority of people are still decent. But now, the far right seems legitimised and popular,” Dabinderjit Singh, a retired senior civil servant said. Singh was reacting to Tommy Robinson’s 13 September far-right “unite the kingdom” rally, which drew 110,000 people to London. The rally’s attenders say they have a variety of concerns. But for some ethnic minority Britons, Saturday’s scenes were reminiscent of far-right marches 50 years ago. Hetticia McIntosh, 70, from Manchester, was returning from holiday via Heathrow when she was warned by a WhatsApp “community safety alert”, to “avoid travelling into London … especially if you are from an ethnic minority.” For ex-servicewoman McIntosh, the times evoke memories of her east London, Windrush generation youth – when “we lived through the skinheads” and racial abuse was daubed on walls. McIntosh knows exactly where racist sentiment can lead. The Home Office inexplicably refused to renew her and her husband’s British passports in the 1970s and 1980s, forcing them to leave the country for St Lucia for decades. She now fears, amid talk of “remigration” from the far right, hardening attitudes to legal migration in Westminster and a government struggling to convey a positive message of unity, that “another Windrush scandal” could happen. This year far-right groups have capitalised on asylum hotel protests, while the “raise the colours” campaign has led to St George’s and union flags being flown from lampposts and painted on roundabouts nationwide. While for many, the flags are a celebration of national pride, St George’s crosses have been grafittied, sometimes with slurs, on ethnic minority-owned businesses and places of worship including a Manchester church, a Reading mosque and a York Chinese takeaway. Last week, police in Oldbury, West Midlands received a report that a Sikh woman had been violently sexually assaulted and told: “You don’t belong here, get out.” Robinson condemned the attack, saying shortly before the rally there was a distinction between “bad scumbags” and “decent minorities”, and that “as we attempt to unite this kingdom against mass immigration … I will speak personally of the sacrifices and great contribution that the Sikh community have made to Great Britain.” For Singh, among community leaders dealing with the attack’s aftermath, Robinson’s remarks are part of a “divide and rule” tactic in which the right has tried to “cozy up to Sikhs” and contrast them with Muslims, while Sikhs with “turbans and beards” were increasingly targeted in racial attacks after 9/11. “I think we are in more worrying, dangerous times than the 70s,” Singh said. “We have people playing on the sentiments of the majority in many countries – not just the UK, but the US, Europe, in India.” The rhetoric, in and out of Westminster, is leaving some ethnic minority Britons with long memories wondering how far t

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
For Singh, among community leaders dealing with the attack’s aftermath, Robinson’s remarks are part of a “divide and rule” tactic in which the right has tried to “cozy up to Sikhs” and contrast them with Muslims, while Sikhs with “turbans and beards” were increasingly targeted in racial attacks after 9/11. For ex-servicewoman McIntosh, the times evoke memories of her east London, Windrush generation youth – when “we lived through the skinheads” and racial abuse was daubed on walls. “Minorities feel trapped,” he said. “We have had multiple reports of Muslim women taking extra precautions in recent weeks, with many choosing to stay at home on Saturday. Nigel Bromage, founder of counter-extremism group Exit Hate, also hears history’s echoes. “The underlying conditions for such movements – economic inequality, social grievances and a sense of disenfranchisement – have all been present for some time.” This year far-right groups have capitalised on asylum hotel protests, while the “raise the colours” campaign has led to St George’s and union flags being flown from lampposts and painted on roundabouts nationwide.

ARTICLE TITLE: Starmer will hand Britain over to Farage, says Green party leader Zack Polanski
DOMAIN: Politics

ORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):
The Greens are coming directly to challenge Labour, the party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, has told its conference, saying that as things stand, Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Addressing a packed event in Bournemouth, Polanski condemned what he called Labour’s “managed decline” and the aping of Reform policies in areas such as migration. Polanski, who is Jewish and grew up in Manchester, expressed his horror at the attack on a synagogue in the city on Thursday and made a strong defence of migration. “This is a party not afraid to say migration has helped make this country what we are today. And it’s made this party too,” said Polanski, who changed his surname from Paulden to Polanski when he was 18, reversing the anglicisation his relatives adopted when they arrived from eastern Europe. Polanski, who won the election to lead the party in England and Wales last month, cited his background and those of the party’s deputy leaders, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward. “I’m one of five Jewish people to lead a British political party in the last 100 years,” he said. “And that also means that I do want to spend a moment to mark yesterday’s awful attack. As a Jewish man raised in north Manchester – I feel this deeply and my heart is with the community. “More widely I am the product of migration. It’s why defending migrants matters so much to me. It’s a common Jewish experience – a tale as old as time.” His ancestors, who moved to England from Latvia via Ukraine and Poland, still faced antisemitism in the UK, he said: “They changed their name to sound more English – and I changed it back, knowing that real pride comes from no longer hiding who you are.” His deputies, Polanski went on, were Ali, the son of a steelworker whose parents came to the UK from what is now Bangladesh in the 60s, and Millward, who “has family roots tied to England as far back as she knows”. He said: “One brought up Jewish. One raised Muslim. One a child of the church. A leadership with three different backstories, in a country enriched by people from all over the world.” With Green membership having risen rapidly since Polanski’s victory and climbing to more than 80,000 for the first time, he told the event that it was time for the party to be ambitious. “Everything we do between now and the next election must be bold,” he said. “We have a vision for this place we call home. Boldness means connecting with how hard it is right now for so many people. It means listening, not just finger-pointing. “At every opportunity, from the doorstep to the TV studio, our message is that the Green party will bring down your bills, cut the cost of living and protect our NHS.” In a series of attacks on the government, Polanski said it had no apparent answers to the problems created by austerity and inequality. “Its politics is one of managed decline dressed up as national renewal and draped in Reform-bating policymaking,” he said. “More of the same from Keir Starmer won’t

SUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):
The Greens are coming directly to challenge Labour, the party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, has told its conference, saying that as things stand, Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Addressing a packed event in Bournemouth, Polanski condemned what he called Labour’s “managed decline” and the aping of Reform policies in areas such as migration. Polanski particularly took aim at Starmer for, he said, trying to copy Reform, including over migration and asylum, “When Farage says jump, Labour might say, ‘How high?’” he said. Polanski, who is Jewish and grew up in Manchester, expressed his horror at the attack on a synagogue in the city on Thursday and made a strong defence of migration. With Green membership having risen rapidly since Polanski’s victory and climbing to more than 80,000 for the first time, he told the event that it was time for the party to be ambitious. Polanski said the time had come for the party to take the fight to Labour. And it’s made this party too,” said Polanski, who changed his surname from Paulden to Polanski when he was 18, reversing the anglicisation his relatives adopted when they arrived from eastern Europe.
