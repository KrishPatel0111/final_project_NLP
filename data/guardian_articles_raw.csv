politics/2025/oct/25/history-repeating-fight-against-far-right-in-london-east-end,‘History is repeating itself’: fight against far-right in London’s East End goes on,"“The East End of London is the far right’s prime target – the essence of everything they don’t like. They feel if they can march through our borough with impunity, they can go anywhere. For them, it’s like Wembley (stadium), it’s the ultimate goal,” said Glyn Robbins, co-founder of United East End, an anti-far right coalition of community organisations. In the East End, the historically working-class neighbourhoods in the shadow of the City of London, there’s a feeling that history is repeating itself. It was 89 years ago this month that local people, many of them British Jews, drove out Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirt militia from Whitechapel in the East End, in what has become known as the Battle of Cable Street. In the decades since, the National Front, the BNP and the English Defence League have all tried to carve out a foothold in the East End. In 2025, communities are fighting back against the hard right yet again. This week, rather than attempting to escort protesters, as they had in Mosley’s day, London’s police stopped the hard right UK Independence Party (Ukip) from staging a “crusade on Whitechapel” in the borough of Tower Hamlets, where 40% of the population is Muslim and 14% were born in the EU. The Metropolitan police said the ban was to prevent “serious disorder.” It comes weeks after Tower Hamlets council passed a motion that said flags were “important emblems of patriotism and pride”, but condemned “outside far-right agitators … attempting to import division into our borough,” particularly on the Isle of Dogs, where the far-right BNP won a council seat back in 1993. Furious far-right influencer Tommy Robinson tweeted the photographs of nine British Muslim councillors to his 1.7 million followers, saying: “Here’s a list of the names and faces of Tower Hamlets council for some perspective.” The government’s decision to place asylum seekers at Britannia International Hotel in Canary Wharf, Tower Hamlets has attracted intense anti-migrant protest since the summer, including from a group called the Pink Ladies who say they are concerned about safety. While this weekend’s Ukip march has been stopped, counter-protesters still plan to gather in Whitechapel on Saturday. Dave Rosenberg, who has run walking tours through the East End since 2007, including on local anti-fascist history, will be among them. “I think we owe it to our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents to continue that struggle in the East End,” said Rosenberg, 67. For Rosenberg, the ban on the march was a “double-edged sword” – “a relief to the most targeted communities”, but also “giving wider and wider powers to police to say who can demonstrate and where”. “There’s a very direct parallel with the 1930s,” he said. In 1936, the Public Order Act was introduced to inhibit Mosley’s British Union of Fascists. Mosley’s wasn’t the first anti-immigrant movement to target the area – back in 1901, the British Brothers’ League (BBL) launched itself with a 1,000-strong rally in the East End, with the slogan “England for the English” and targeting Russian and Polish Jewish migrants. For Rosenberg, the repeated battle against the far right in the East End reflects two different visions of working-class life – one diverse, the other homogenous. “It’s this sense that those organisations have had, from BBL to Ukip today, that this is ‘our territory’… and people are invaders and encroaching in our territory,” Rosenberg said. Last week, Safia Jama, the 47-year-old CEO of the charity Women’s Inclusive Team, was chairing a Stand Up to Racism meeting when it was disrupted by rightwing protesters. “I did not feel safe. I never ran out of somewhere so quickly,” she said. When she was a young girl, her father was attacked in Tower Hamlets and left disabled as a result. The community has seen “huge achievements” since: Brick Lane and Spitalfields have experienced profound regeneration – and gentrification – and Canary Wharf is a leading financial centre. While 62.7% of all residents in employment are in managerial or professional occupations, the borough has the highest rate of child poverty in the country, with about 27,000 people on the housing list, and about 15,000 people in overcrowded homes. With a median age of 30, it is the youngest borough in England and Wales, as well as one of the UK’s most socially and ethnically diverse areas. “This is our home. We’ve made it our home,” Jama said. “We’ve invested tears, sweat, blood, whatever it might be, we’ve really worked hard to create an environment that is beautiful.” But for months, tensions have been simmering in Tower Hamlets, as rightwingers have made its diversity the centre of a culture war. The latest escalation began in February, when Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe tweeted about dual language signs in English and Bengali at Whitechapel tube station. “This is London,” he wrote. “The station name should be in English, and in English only.” Elon Musk replied: “Yes”. By June, Robinson was complaining about bilingual children in Whitechapel, adding “a district once synonymous with Jack the Ripper and the Kray twins and home to the nation’s true cockneys, now this.” Lutfur Rahman, Tower Hamlets’ British Bengali mayor, described the online attack as “despicable”. Rahman has defied controversies to lead the borough repeatedly since 2008, with progressive social policies. All primary and secondary schoolchildren enjoy free school meals, the borough provides university bursaries and the education maintenance allowance for working-class teenagers and is investing, the leadership says, £700m in council homes, funded by “taxing wealth, and high business rates for big business”. Rahman said: “In the late 1980s and early 90s, parts of the borough were no-go areas for people of colour. Since then successive leaders have invested in the people of the borough – and it’s worked well for us. We have over 300,000 people, we don’t want anyone to feel left out. “Now, 90% of our residents say they get one with each other. I grew up in this borough, our white neighbours helped my mother, helped me when my father went to work. My mum couldn’t speak English, it was our neighbours, the community spirit of the East End, that got us through those difficult days in the 70s and 80s.” In September, the borough hosted a festival to celebrate this legacy, in a direct response to Robinson’s “unite the kingdom” rally in central London. New dual language signs were unveiled on the town hall – the restored former Royal London hospital – a snub to Lowe and Musk. Pearly kings and queens, a steel band, Celtic dancers, klezmer musicians, Bengali, Somali and Chinese acts performed and told stories of the East End through the ages, while a curry festival took place on Brick Lane, events attracting 25,000 people over two days. “The truth is, in the midst of all rancour and in the midst of all uncertainty, there is hope,” said Rev James Olanipekun, co-chair of the Tower Hamlets interfaith forum. “We are united and we are together.” Living in the borough has not been without incident for Olanipekun. Once, a brick was thrown at his wife’s car. “I didn’t look at it, I said nothing. After all, I was insured,” he said with a laugh. “Racism has a long history and Tower Hamlets, we’ve had a particular variant of it,” Robbins, a university lecturer who has seen off numerous far-right marches since United East End was created in 2010. “(But) now, what they’re saying is being echoed by the government, or the government in-waiting.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/25/history-repeating-fight-against-far-right-in-london-east-end,Politics,2025-10-25T12:04:23Z,11
politics/2025/oct/19/support-for-reform-uk-surges-nigel-farage-among-british-indians,"Support for Reform UK increasing among British Indians, poll shows","Support for Reform UK among British Indians has tripled since the election, according to polling from a diaspora group that suggests Nigel Farage’s party is gaining ground in some demographics where it has struggled. Research by the 1928 Institute, a group of Oxford academics who analyse the British Indian community, shows backing for Reform has jumped in the past year from 4% to 13%. The findings, which are being released to coincide with Diwali, show support for Farage’s party among Britain’s largest minority ethnic community remains well below the national level. But the increase since the election is far higher than the national average, showing Reform is building momentum in communities where it has traditionally struggled. The report said: “British Indian support for Reform is significantly lower than that of the general UK population. However, there is a strong upwards trend in support.” British Indians, who form about 3% of the population, are becoming increasingly important swing voters. For decades they were closely allied with the Labour party, which was regarded as being more tolerant of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. But those ties have begun to fray as the community has become more established and its policy priorities have started to tally more closely with those of the rest of the population. Social conservatism among Indian voters and growing nationalism among Hindus in particular have helped drive them further right on the political spectrum, researchers say. A report in 2021 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found Labour’s support for Kashmiri independence during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership had been a particular turn-off for British Indian voters. Farage has expressed mixed views on south Asian immigration. The Reform leader criticised the government’s recent trade deal with India for making it easier to bring in workers from the subcontinent but said in 2015 that he preferred Indian and Australian migrants to those from eastern Europe. The findings from the 1928 Institute are taken from a report on the demographics and political priorities of the Indian community in the UK. The academics surveyed more than 2,000 voters earlier this year and compared the results with voting patterns last year and a similar poll carried out five years ago. They found that at the last election 48% of British Indians voted for Labour, 21% for the Conservatives and only 4% for Reform. At the election five years earlier, Reform won just 0.4% of the British Indian vote. Now, however, Labour support stands at 35% with the Indian community, while the Conservatives have collapsed to 18%. Support for the Greens has also risen sharply, especially among younger voters, going from 8% at the election to 13% now. The research shows the shift is being driven in part by changing policy priorities. While Indian voters always put education at the top of their concerns, their second priority has changed from health five years ago to the economy now. Their third priority is crime, having been the environment five years ago. Equalities and human rights has dropped from fifth on the list of priorities to seventh. Nikita Ved, a co-author of the report, said: “Reform UK’s rise is disrupting traditional voting patterns within the British Indian community. As economic and social frustrations deepen, both major parties may face growing pressure to engage more directly with a community whose political loyalties can no longer be taken for granted.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/19/support-for-reform-uk-surges-nigel-farage-among-british-indians,Politics,2025-10-19T13:37:49Z,8
politics/2025/oct/03/synagogue-attack-senior-uk-jewish-politician-richard-hermer,"We are heartbroken after synagogue attack, says senior UK Jewish politician","One of UK’s most senior Jewish politicians has said he and the Jewish community are “heartbroken, frightened and angry” after the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue. Richard Hermer, the attorney general and a close ally of Keir Starmer in cabinet, said tackling a rising tide of antisemitism would require police protection and political leaders calling it out wherever it was found. The country’s most senior lawyer made the intervention in Jewish News, saying more must be done to tackle antisemitism and to bring communities together. “We are heartbroken. We are frightened. We are angry. The rising tide of antisemitism has been plain for all to see yet is too often explained away,” he wrote. “British Jews are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for the same thing every family, of every faith, should expect: to live and worship freely, without fear. That means, tragically in these times, police on the ground. It means protecting our schools and synagogues. And it means leaders in every party and community calling out antisemitism wherever it appears.” He said stepping up protections for Jewish communities was the right response but it “cannot be the end of the conversation”. “The focus will not just be on security and justice but on how we can bring communities together to heal from this. This government is determined to build a country where no minority has to live in fear and where antisemitism is confronted without hesitation, without qualification and without excuse.” Starmer issued a message to Jewish people on Thursday night pledging to “wrap arms” around the community in the wake of the attack. In a recorded message, Starmer said: “I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do … Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. “And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community. I promise you that over the coming days you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love.” Starmer, whose wife, Victoria, is Jewish, made tackling antisemitism in Labour a major priority after he became party leader.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/03/synagogue-attack-senior-uk-jewish-politician-richard-hermer,Politics,2025-10-03T16:58:34Z,7
politics/2025/oct/16/drag-acts-detractors-and-true-blue-diehards-my-weird-weekend-at-a-margaret-thatcher-festival,"Drag acts, detractors and true-blue diehards: my weird weekend at a Margaret Thatcher festival","The bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher by the sculptor Douglas Jennings has a rating of 2.8 out of five on Google Maps. Although curiously, none of the reviewers seems to have overly preoccupied themselves with the quality of the craftsmanship or the fidelity of the likeness. “One of the most important PMs this country ever had,” writes one. “It’s a public toilet but there’s nowhere to wash your hands,” writes another. The statue was originally commissioned more than a decade ago, and was intended to stand in front of the Houses of Parliament, but Westminster city council rejected it on the grounds that it might become a target for vandalism. Instead, it was offered to her birthplace of Grantham, a town she left at the age of 18 and rarely visited again. Within hours of its installation, someone threw an egg at it. Shortly after that, it was defaced with red paint. And now, on a grey October afternoon, Margaret Thatcher herself is gazing upon it, bearing a look of pure disgust. “They’ve got the date wrong,” she moans, her trademark handbag sliding down a blue-sleeved arm pointed accusingly upwards. “It says I died in 2013. As you can see, I am very much alive.” The presence of Thatcher in her home town, on what would have been her 100th birthday, has drawn a small crowd outside the town’s Guildhall Arts Centre. Motorists toot horns; fans want selfies; passersby occasionally flick V-signs from across the street. A middle-aged woman approaches and clasps Thatcher’s hands in her own. “I just want to say, if it weren’t for you, I would never have been able to buy my house.” “That’s wonderful,” Thatcher replies. “And are you still living in the house?” “No,” the woman says. “I sold it to my son.” Somehow it scarcely matters that the figure they are venerating and vilifying is not Thatcher at all, but an actor named Matt Tedford, who plays the former prime minister in a riotous drag show called Margaret Thatcher: Queen of Soho, which played at the Guildhall on Monday night. In the show, Britain’s first female prime minister is depicted walking the streets of London on the night before the section 28 vote in parliament in 1987, stumbling upon a gay bar and ultimately reinventing herself as a disco diva. It’s sharp, topical, ridiculous and very funny. Tedford has been portraying Thatcher for 12 years – “longer than she was prime minister”, he observes wryly. The role has taken him to some strange and random places. He’s met party leaders. He’s been for dinner at the Foreign Office. He’s shared a stage with Kemi Badenoch at a book launch. For a character that began life as a gaudy Halloween costume around the start of the last decade, it’s been quite a ride. As he puts it: “I always say I’m the only northerner she ever gave work to.” Now his work has brought him to Thatcher Fest: a clever wheeze cooked up by Grantham’s local councillors to commemorate the centenary of its most famous daughter. There are talks and walks, Thatcher-themed music nights and exhibitions of memorabilia, Gyles Brandreth giving a lecture on Thatcher’s unlikely connection to Winnie-the-Pooh, exhibitions of her exercise books at the local school and newspaper clippings at the library. It’s attracted all sorts: Queen of Soho was uproariously received by a largely progressive crowd, while the true-blue diehards packed out the Guildhall for a talk by Edwina Currie, asking reliably bone-headed questions about what Thatcher would have made of “today’s political correctness”. Not everything has been a riotous success: one of the walking tours at the weekend attracted just five people. But for a small town known to most as a stop on the East Coast Main Line, it is the spotlight they crave. “Grantham has never had as much publicity as it has this week,” boasts Ashley Baxter, the independent leader of the local South Kesteven district council. “Having Queen of Soho upset the Conservatives. Having a Thatcher Fest at all upset the left. We’re upsetting all the right people. Which is only right, because people are still … very emotional about her.” On a wider level, the anniversary has been marked with the usual spume of reassessment, revisionism, tie-in content and outright silliness. The phrase “whatever you thought of her politics” has been flogged to within an inch of its life. At the recent Tory conference in Manchester, their former leader was a weirdly pervasive, almost phantasmagorical presence in the hall: cardboard cutouts, a photo mosaic, an AI Thatcher, her outfits displayed in a glass case. There has been a new book alleging that she had two extramarital affairs, a birthday gala dinner in London, an Unherd article on Thatcher’s “erotic power” that describes her as “a nursery dominatrix, thrashing grown-up little boys who confuse punishment with love”. More than three decades after she left politics, it seems there are still plenty desperate to reanimate her by incantation. And there is a certain irony here, for during her time Thatcher was largely uninterested in furnishing the iconography or cult of personality that grew around her: a life, as her biographer Charles Moore observed, “unexamined by the person who lived it”. She was unmoved by questions of legacy, never kept a diary, threw away huge piles of her documents. She wanted to be consequential. But she was never overly fussed about her place in history. And so what remains of Thatcher today is essentially a palimpsest; a dirty print of projected feelings and half-remembered catchphrases, slavish adoration and bogeyman hatred. This is doubly true for subsequent generations with no actual memories of her. “You meet lots of young people who think they should hate Thatcher, but don’t necessarily know who she was, what effect she had on their lives,” says Tedford. “They know she closed the mines. They know about the milk. There’s a remove there, where we’ve been able to appraise her differently to a generation who grew up with her as a present-tense villain.” Naturally enough, current politics also intrude here, as Thatcher’s old party stands on the brink of collapse, as traditional institutions lie in ruins, as a surging far right evoke her memory while simultaneously running from her libertarian brand of small-state economics. And of course it is only natural to wonder what she would have made of the rise of Reform and open blood-and-soil nativism, the St George’s flags brandished forebodingly from the upstairs windows of Grantham’s narrow terraced houses. Is this what she wanted? Is the new far right a continuation of Thatcherism, or a reaction against it? “Thatcher remains part of Grantham’s story, and rightly so,” says Ben Green, a Reform councillor who defected from the Conservatives this summer, in an email. “But the challenges we face today are very different from those of the 1980s. Her reforms revived enterprise but left too many industrial towns behind. In my view, the country now needs a more patriotic and muscular state: pro-enterprise, yes. But also pro-community.” Moore doesn’t, on a point of principle, answer hypotheticals about what Thatcher might have done or believed today. But there are elements of Reform’s current appeal that, he suggests, did not chime with hers. “She was not interested in racial stuff at all,” he says. “And of course she was completely against repatriation, which she thought was inhumane, and also sort of nonsensical.” Back in Grantham, Currie has just finished giving a talk on Thatcher and feminism to an audience of enraptured diehards and a few dozen extremely bored-looking schoolchildren on a field trip. Baxter, the council leader, is in his office reflecting on Thatcher’s true legacy in the town. And for all its gilded heritage, this is a place with largely familiar issues: closing shops, a shortage of housing, a shrunken civic life, a basic absence of identity. “My colleagues will walk down the London Road and say: ‘Oh, that used to be a machining place. That used to be a factory. That was where so many people worked.’ But this is the story of the UK. “Then on the high street, you’ll see we’ve got our fair share of empty shops,” Baxter continues. “We’re trying to put works of art into them. And because of Thatcher, and the subsequent austerity governments, you’re only allowed art by stealth. If I said tomorrow we needed an arts officer on a salary of £30,000, the answer would – correctly – be that we haven’t got any money. Same with leisure. I’m in this job because the Tories shut down my local leisure centre in 2021 and we’re trying to find a way to reopen it.” Perhaps the most generous view of Thatcher is that she was a prime minister with no real concept of the long-term consequences of her actions. Perhaps she genuinely did believe that her wave of liberalisations would secure the greatest comfort for the greatest number, a little patriotic paradise in which everyone would own their own house and a little nest egg in British Telecom shares. Perhaps she failed to properly anticipate the storm of globalisation, the way it ripped the soul out of communities and created a staggering concentration of wealth among a very few. Perhaps you might even argue that, given the prevailing global currents of the 1980s, if it wasn’t Thatcher, it would have been someone else. But, of course, it was Thatcher, a naturally combative politician who saw ideological enemies at every turn, urgent and angry and unafraid of disruption. And perhaps the real legacy of her time is the death of the principle that we could all somehow prosper together. More than any other figure in our lifetime, Thatcher embedded the idea that our own circumstances can only ever be improved at the expense of someone else, by picking the right side and fighting for eternity, the politics of envy and cruelty and vindictiveness baked into our electoral calculus. You will be fine, because others will not. Perhaps this is why on some level people still want her to be real, to berate her or whisper sweet nothings in her ear, and are prepared to elide the infinite layers of makeup, artifice and literal death in order to do so. But of course the woman herself has largely disappeared from view. You can’t throw an egg at deregulation. You can’t hurl paint over decades of rising house prices. The devastated former industrial towns of the north, the Midlands, Scotland and Wales possess precious little erotic dominatrix power. Back to Grantham rail station we go, past the statue of another local hero, Isaac Newton (Google rating: 4.7), dodging the four lanes of traffic and a deregulated local bus as we cross the road outside the big Wetherspoons. On the other side, a shuttered cafe sits alongside a branch of the local estate agents, the latter staffed by young men and women wearing suits and headsets. Thatcher’s old school is now an academy. The station car park is now run by a private firm and charges £5.45 for 24 hours. Inside the station there is a choice of Costa or Starbucks. Maybe Tedford was right after all: it says she died in 2013, but as you can see, she is very much alive.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/drag-acts-detractors-and-true-blue-diehards-my-weird-weekend-at-a-margaret-thatcher-festival,Politics,2025-10-16T09:00:02Z,5
politics/2025/sep/16/for-some-minority-britons-the-unite-the-kingdom-rally-shows-far-right-politics-is-becoming-legitimised,For some minority Britons the ‘unite the kingdom’ rally shows far-right politics is becoming legitimised,"“I remember my father marching against the National Front in the 1970s. It felt like it was a minority. The majority of people are still decent. But now, the far right seems legitimised and popular,” Dabinderjit Singh, a retired senior civil servant said. Singh was reacting to Tommy Robinson’s 13 September far-right “unite the kingdom” rally, which drew 110,000 people to London. The rally’s attenders say they have a variety of concerns. But for some ethnic minority Britons, Saturday’s scenes were reminiscent of far-right marches 50 years ago. Hetticia McIntosh, 70, from Manchester, was returning from holiday via Heathrow when she was warned by a WhatsApp “community safety alert”, to “avoid travelling into London … especially if you are from an ethnic minority.” For ex-servicewoman McIntosh, the times evoke memories of her east London, Windrush generation youth – when “we lived through the skinheads” and racial abuse was daubed on walls. McIntosh knows exactly where racist sentiment can lead. The Home Office inexplicably refused to renew her and her husband’s British passports in the 1970s and 1980s, forcing them to leave the country for St Lucia for decades. She now fears, amid talk of “remigration” from the far right, hardening attitudes to legal migration in Westminster and a government struggling to convey a positive message of unity, that “another Windrush scandal” could happen. This year far-right groups have capitalised on asylum hotel protests, while the “raise the colours” campaign has led to St George’s and union flags being flown from lampposts and painted on roundabouts nationwide. While for many, the flags are a celebration of national pride, St George’s crosses have been grafittied, sometimes with slurs, on ethnic minority-owned businesses and places of worship including a Manchester church, a Reading mosque and a York Chinese takeaway. Last week, police in Oldbury, West Midlands received a report that a Sikh woman had been violently sexually assaulted and told: “You don’t belong here, get out.” Robinson condemned the attack, saying shortly before the rally there was a distinction between “bad scumbags” and “decent minorities”, and that “as we attempt to unite this kingdom against mass immigration … I will speak personally of the sacrifices and great contribution that the Sikh community have made to Great Britain.” For Singh, among community leaders dealing with the attack’s aftermath, Robinson’s remarks are part of a “divide and rule” tactic in which the right has tried to “cozy up to Sikhs” and contrast them with Muslims, while Sikhs with “turbans and beards” were increasingly targeted in racial attacks after 9/11. “I think we are in more worrying, dangerous times than the 70s,” Singh said. “We have people playing on the sentiments of the majority in many countries – not just the UK, but the US, Europe, in India.” The rhetoric, in and out of Westminster, is leaving some ethnic minority Britons with long memories wondering how far things could go. Labour proposes doubling the standard qualifying period for settled status for legal, taxpaying skilled migrants from five years to 10 years. Last week, Tory MP Katie Lam said this was “not enough”, adding: “No new visa should be issued to, no new ILR [indefinite leave to remain] status should be granted to, and existing ILR status should be revoked from those who have committed a crime, accessed state support or are unlikely to contribute more than they cost. Those who have no legal way to stay here would then need to leave.” McIntosh, who has already experienced the Windrush scandal’s unofficial “remigration” scheme said: “History is repeating itself. That should frighten us all. Because no society can move forward if it keeps repeating the same prejudice. “We deserve dignity, not fear, in our later years. The more things change, the more they remain the same. When I saw that rally in London, it brought me right back. It’s heartbreaking. It’s down to a lack of teaching. If you did not go there, we would not be here.” Nigel Bromage, founder of counter-extremism group Exit Hate, also hears history’s echoes. He was in the National Front and Combat 18 in the 1980s and 1990s, before turning his back on neo-nazism. He said: “We are living in dark times – we ignore these signs at our peril. While the London rally was presented as an inclusive event, it attracted not only frustrated and unheard individuals but also hardcore British nationalists and neo-Nazis, all of whom seek to spread their message. “The underlying conditions for such movements – economic inequality, social grievances and a sense of disenfranchisement – have all been present for some time.” The prospect of a far-right, Elon Musk-backed government no longer seems unthinkable, a representative of the UK Indian Muslim Council said. “Minorities feel trapped,” he said. “Like they don’t belong anywhere. I was driving recently with my wife by my side and someone rolled down their window, called me [the p-word] and drove off.” The British Muslim Trust (BMT), the government’s new Islamophobia monitoring partner, says the atmosphere is deeply concerning. BMT chief executive, Akeela Ahmed, added: “There is no question that events like Saturday – which saw divisive rhetoric and despicable levels of violence – are causing deep unease. “We have had multiple reports of Muslim women taking extra precautions in recent weeks, with many choosing to stay at home on Saturday. This is intolerable.” For Singh, there is concern that the government is unable or unwilling to tackle racism. “I want [home secretary] Shabana Mahmood, as a Muslim woman, not simply to focus on immigration, but deal with racism and attacks against women. “If she fails in that, then I think the writing is on the wall that we don’t have a political leadership that can get out of the ballot box politics authoritarian states go towards, which is please the majority and penalise minorities.” Meanwhile, anti-racist campaigners the Runnymede Trust fear mainstream politicians have “lost control of this narrative to the likes of (Elon) Musk” after “legitimising racism”. They added: “It is significant that Saturday was also Stephen Lawrence’s birthday. Racism kills.” Angela Rayner was developing a social cohesion strategy before her resignation. A spokesperson for the communities department said: “Racism is completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. “We are determined to bridge divisions between communities and the work of the social cohesion taskforce will continue, reporting to the prime minister.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/for-some-minority-britons-the-unite-the-kingdom-rally-shows-far-right-politics-is-becoming-legitimised,Politics,2025-09-16T05:00:29Z,5
politics/2025/aug/29/reform-council-removes-st-george-and-union-flags-over-safety-fears,Reform UK council removes St George and union flags over safety fears,"A Reform-led council has started to remove flags and bunting displaying the St George’s cross and the union flag after concerns were raised that they could cause accidents. Durham county council issued a statement on X on Friday saying that while the council “understand and respect the community’s desire to express national pride, celebration, or remembrance, it is important to ensure such expressions do not compromise public safety”. The council claimed it had been “left with no choice but to remove bunting” after a risk assessment found that “rope involved was so strong that, had a high-sided vehicle driven into it, the poles it was attached to could have been pulled down”. The statement said the council’s “priority remains ensuring the safety and integrity of the highway network, while being mindful of, and responsive to, the communities we serve”. It encouraged residents “to consider safer and more appropriate locations for flags or other displays that do not involve highway infrastructure and conform to all appropriate standards and regulations”. In the past few weeks there has been increasing controversy over the number of flags being flown in towns across England. Some say it is simply a show of national pride and patriotism, while others argue the swell of interest in flying flags is linked to the far right and anti-migrant sentiment. Instances of vandalism have been recorded, including red lines being spray-painted on to white roundabouts to replicate the St George’s cross. Councils throughout the country have responded in different ways. Some, such as Lib Dem-run Hertfordshire council and Labour-run Brighton council have said that they will remove flags, with Brighton saying that “when it comes to items attached to lamp-posts or defaced roundabouts, it is normal council procedure for these to be removed on a regular basis, in line with our health and safety obligations”. Darren Grimes, a political commentator who is the deputy leader of Durham county council and a member of Reform UK, has repeatedly commented on his X account about flags being flown in England, including a video with the caption: “This isn’t just flying a flag. It’s the start of the fightback.” The Reform MP Lee Anderson has also posted frequently about his desire for more flags to be flown around the country, including a post on Monday showing a letter he had written to the government five years ago, with the caption: “It’s nearly 5 years ago since I wrote to the last government to ask for the Union flag to be flown from every single public building in the UK. I’m still waiting for an answer.” Other posts from Grimes in the past month include him expressing support for union flags being hung from a bridge, while criticising the flying of Pakistani, Palestinian and LGBTQ+ pride flags throughout the country. The topic has attracted comment and debate beyond Britain, with the tech mogul and outspoken Reform UK supporter Elon Musk posting a St George’s cross to his X feed on Tuesday and the US vice-president, JD Vance, urging people in the UK to “push back against crazies” who criticise the flag-flying. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has not commented on the recent flag debate, but was candid about his views on the line between patriotism and nationalism during a briefing on St George’s Day in April of this year. He said: “I do understand the fight over the flag … but that’s why we’ve got to reclaim it. It belongs to all of us.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/29/reform-council-removes-st-george-and-union-flags-over-safety-fears,Politics,2025-08-29T14:48:00Z,5
politics/2025/oct/13/uk-charities-toxic-immigration-rhetoric-threats-staff,UK charities say toxic immigration rhetoric leading to threats against staff,"Charities have warned of growing racial abuse, intimidation and threats of violence towards their staff and beneficiaries amid increasingly toxic rhetoric around immigration and race by politicians and extremist activists. Voluntary organisations say they are being forced to introduce extensive security measures to protect staff and property – a trend described by one charity head as in danger of becoming the “new normal” – after being targeted. Refugee and asylum seeker charities, Muslim, Jewish and ethnic minority organisations, women’s groups, youth bodies, homelessness charities and even charity shops have reported being subject to violence, threats and abuse. Incidents include threats to rape and kill staff, verbal and physical abuse of beneficiaries on the street, attempted break-ins to charity-owned accommodation, and damage to offices and vandalism, including anti-migrant and racist graffiti. Charities were being “targeted because of what they stand for and who they support”, said Saskia Konynenburg, executive director at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The threat has become more explicit and targeted since the far-right Southport riots in 2024 and the spread of inflammatory political and social media rhetoric around immigrants and “small boats”, say charities. They add the abuse has become more extreme and uninhibited in the way it is expressed or enacted, both on and offline. A coalition of more than 150 charities including Age UK, Citizens Advice and the Muslim Council of Britain has written to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, urging him to challenge the “cynical” targeting of civil society organisations by far-right politicians and activists seeking to stoke division for political gain in local communities. Ali Harris, the chief executive of equality and human rights charity Equally Ours, which organised the letter, said: “The devastating antisemitic attack at Heaton Park Synagogue is a tragic reminder that it’s never been more important for us all to stand united when any of our communities are targeted. “We are taking this collective stand because the organisations in this coalition and the communities we serve are experiencing growing threats and aggression – in places of worship, offices, shops, on public transport and high streets. People with extreme views are increasingly violent in how they express or act on their hatred.” One charity chief executive told the Guardian increasingly mainstream political rhetoric on the political right denigrating immigrants and refugees, and stoking community divisions along ethnic lines had created a “permission structure” for racism which had emboldened far-right activists. Last month, a drugs and alcohol charity in east London that formerly shared its premises with a refugee support charity was daubed with a George Cross and far-right graffiti. Volunteers repainted the office front only for far-right activists to return and deface the building with the slogan “East London stands with Southport”, a reference to the far right riots in Southport in 2024. Some charities have taken drastic safeguarding action in response to the threats including installing safe rooms, fitting staff with phone trackers, hiring security guards, taking down charity signs outside offices, removing staff names from websites and redacting trustee names from publicly available Charity Commission filings. Others have temporarily closed offices on the advice of local police, stopped providing outreach services because of the potential danger to staff and beneficiaries, and drawn up emergency action plans in the event their premises are attacked. One refugee charity head said they currently spent “60% of the time managing safety issues related to far-right activism”. Another charity told the Guardian it was considering spending thousands of pounds on personal safety devices. One charity head described the tight focus on staff security as the “new normal”. The chief executive of a London charity working with asylum seekers, who like most of those the Guardian spoke to wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, said the threats had a chilling effect but staff were determined to continue: “We do the work we do because we care and the people we support have been through terrible things and deserve a bit of kindness.” The letter to the prime minister, sent a fortnight ago, called on the government to provide “clear and consistent leadership” to defend the values of inclusion, equality and anti-racism and “take a stand against the division and hate” fuelled by politicians scapegoating communities for political gain. “We are witnessing the significant damage to people of all backgrounds caused by the far-right’s cynical spreading of division and hostility between communities, their undermining of the rule of law, and the weaponisation of violence against women and girls.” It adds: “We are experiencing increasing racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and antisemitism on the streets and in workplaces, including abuse of charity staff and charity shop volunteers. All this alongside attacks by the media and threats of violence against lawyers and civil society groups working with migrant and other marginalised communities.” A government spokesperson said: “Racism is completely unacceptable and has no place in our society. This government has pride in our tolerant and diverse country, and we are dedicated to tackling inequality at its roots, including working closely with ethnic minority leaders to enact change. “We have a strong legal framework in place to deal with the perpetrators of racism and other forms of hate crime and expect those responsible for these abhorrent offences to be brought to justice.” • This article was amended on 14 October 2025.

politics/2025/oct/03/starmer-will-hand-britain-over-to-farage-says-green-party-leader-zack-polanski,"Starmer will hand Britain over to Farage, says Green party leader Zack Polanski","The Greens are coming directly to challenge Labour, the party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, has told its conference, saying that as things stand, Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK. Addressing a packed event in Bournemouth, Polanski condemned what he called Labour’s “managed decline” and the aping of Reform policies in areas such as migration. Polanski, who is Jewish and grew up in Manchester, expressed his horror at the attack on a synagogue in the city on Thursday and made a strong defence of migration. “This is a party not afraid to say migration has helped make this country what we are today. And it’s made this party too,” said Polanski, who changed his surname from Paulden to Polanski when he was 18, reversing the anglicisation his relatives adopted when they arrived from eastern Europe. Polanski, who won the election to lead the party in England and Wales last month, cited his background and those of the party’s deputy leaders, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward. “I’m one of five Jewish people to lead a British political party in the last 100 years,” he said. “And that also means that I do want to spend a moment to mark yesterday’s awful attack. As a Jewish man raised in north Manchester – I feel this deeply and my heart is with the community. “More widely I am the product of migration. It’s why defending migrants matters so much to me. It’s a common Jewish experience – a tale as old as time.” His ancestors, who moved to England from Latvia via Ukraine and Poland, still faced antisemitism in the UK, he said: “They changed their name to sound more English – and I changed it back, knowing that real pride comes from no longer hiding who you are.” His deputies, Polanski went on, were Ali, the son of a steelworker whose parents came to the UK from what is now Bangladesh in the 60s, and Millward, who “has family roots tied to England as far back as she knows”. He said: “One brought up Jewish. One raised Muslim. One a child of the church. A leadership with three different backstories, in a country enriched by people from all over the world.” With Green membership having risen rapidly since Polanski’s victory and climbing to more than 80,000 for the first time, he told the event that it was time for the party to be ambitious. “Everything we do between now and the next election must be bold,” he said. “We have a vision for this place we call home. Boldness means connecting with how hard it is right now for so many people. It means listening, not just finger-pointing. “At every opportunity, from the doorstep to the TV studio, our message is that the Green party will bring down your bills, cut the cost of living and protect our NHS.” In a series of attacks on the government, Polanski said it had no apparent answers to the problems created by austerity and inequality. “Its politics is one of managed decline dressed up as national renewal and draped in Reform-bating policymaking,” he said. “More of the same from Keir Starmer won’t just fail us now, it will hand this country on a plate to the dark forces around Nigel Farage.” Polanski particularly took aim at Starmer for, he said, trying to copy Reform, including over migration and asylum, “When Farage says jump, Labour might say, ‘How high?’” he said. “But the Greens won’t dance to the tune of a Trump-loving, tax-avoiding, science-denying, NHS-dismantling corporate stooge. We will say it loud, and we will say it clear: migrants and refugees are welcome here.” The arrival of the media-savvy Polanski, who won an overwhelming 85% of the membership vote against a joint bid by two of the party’s MPs, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, has brought the Greens new members and extra attention, with more journalists attending the gathering in Bournemouth than the party’s previous conferences. Polanski said the time had come for the party to take the fight to Labour. “It’s why Labour councillors are defecting. It’s why Labour members are joining. It’s why thousands upon thousands of ex-Labour voters are saying enough is in enough and putting a cross next to the Green party for the first time. Labour’s arrogant assumptions that it is entitled to people’s vote ends today.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/03/starmer-will-hand-britain-over-to-farage-says-green-party-leader-zack-polanski,Politics,2025-10-03T13:33:15Z,3
politics/2025/sep/27/maz-saleem-daughter-of-victim-speaks-after-death-of-neo-nazi-killer-in-jail,‘I refuse to be defined by fascism’: daughter of murder victim speaks after death of neo-Nazi killer in prison,"Neo-Nazi murderer and bomber Pavlo Lapshyn did not get to serve out the 40-year term of his sentence. He was found dead in his cell at Wakefield prison on Tuesday, 12 years after being jailed. The circumstances of his death have not yet been publicly confirmed. The Ukrainian national was 37. He was convicted at the Old Bailey in October 2013 of murdering Muslim man Mohammed Saleem, 82, in April of that year. Saleem was a pillar of the local community who was on his way home from evening prayers at the mosque when Lapshyn stabbed him three times in the back and stamped on his head. Lapshyn later planted three bombs outside mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton. Along with Saleem’s murder, he was convicted of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life and of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He is not known to have expressed any remorse. A picture found on his computer by police had words and images relating to the murder, with a smiley face and the slogan “WHITE POWER”. Saleem’s daughter, Maz Saleem, the youngest of seven children, has said she forgives Lapshyn for taking her father’s life in such a brutal and horrific way. At a time where hatred and division are increasing hers is a rare voice calling for calm and healing. “In the early days after his murder, I wanted revenge,” she says. “I wanted the pain I felt to be felt by the man who killed him. Over time I realised that living in anger would consume me and give the far right even more power over my life. “I’ve recently come to a place of forgiveness as carrying hate in my heart doesn’t help. I’m a very empathetic person and I’m actually feeling for his parents at this time. Parents are parents, aren’t they, and his are very elderly.” She has spent years campaigning against racism and Islamophobia and does not want the murder of her father to continue the cycle of hatred between people from different backgrounds. “I miss my father every day. Pavlo Lapshyn butchered him outside our house, where we used to walk five times a day, every day. “When I heard that he had died in prison, my first reaction was not joy but reflection. I have lived with the consequences of his actions for more than a decade. I have known anger so deep it kept me awake at night. But I have also spent these years deciding not to let hatred dictate my future. “For me, it’s time to forgive, because we need a world of unity. I wish him to rest in peace, and I am keeping his parents in my thoughts.” She was notified of Lapshyn’s death in a brief letter from the Ministry of Justice, stating: “I am writing to inform you that PL has died in custody. As a consequence the involvement of the victim liaison officer in this case has come to an end and our contact with you will cease.” The Prison Service said: “This was an abhorrent crime and our thoughts remain with Mr Saleem’s friends and family.” Maz emphasises that forgiving Lapshyn does not mean she condones what he did. “His actions were gravely wrong and he caused immense pain. But I believe holding on to hatred serves no one. What Pavlo Lapshyn stood for – hatred, extremism and racism – is the opposite of everything our community believes in, and we must continue to stand for forgiveness, justice and peace. I refuse to allow hatred to poison my heart.” She is alarmed by the rise of anti-migrant and far-right campaigners: “The fact that we have 150,000 people marching on our streets holding these views is disturbing, very disturbing,” she says. “We are living in dangerous times. The murder of my father was not an isolated incident. Muslim women have been attacked on our streets, a Sikh woman was allegedly raped, a Bangladeshi boy was assaulted. The far right are emboldened. “Britain must take far-right violence as seriously as any other form of terrorism. That means protecting places of worship, resourcing counter-extremism programmes, educating young people, holding those who spread hate to account, and supporting victims’ families beyond the first weeks of tragedy.” She says her much-loved father, who came to the UK in 1957, settled in the West Midlands, working first at a steelworks and then in a bakery, always told her that “education is key, knowledge is power”, and encouraged her to stand up for what is right. “More than 6,000 people came to his funeral because he had spent his life serving others – guiding young people away from crime, encouraging girls to pursue education, and bringing neighbours together.” She says her decision to forgive Lapshyn has been greeted largely positively. “I have received overwhelming support and solidarity. Women have reached out to thank me, saying this is the lesson racists need to hear. To those who celebrate anyone’s death, I say: I understand the pain and anger, but we must not become what we despise. “My father’s story is not just a chapter in the history of far-right terror – it is a warning. His legacy must be more than grief. It must be a call to confront hate, build solidarity, and create a future where no one is targeted for how they look, how they worship, or where they come from. Forgiveness is my way of refusing to be defined by fascism – but my fight for justice is far from over.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/27/maz-saleem-daughter-of-victim-speaks-after-death-of-neo-nazi-killer-in-jail,Politics,2025-09-27T14:00:44Z,3

But now in the run-up to Christmas, the former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn will bring that experience to bear as he appears in pantomime at a north London theatre. The Islington North MP, who sits as an independent, will perform as the “Wizard of Oz-lington” in a drag production of Wicked Witches. The venue said he would make an onscreen cameo. “The Pleasance [theatre] has been at the heart of our community for 30 years, and local theatre like this deserves our support,” Corbyn said. “Panto brings people together – it’s fun, inclusive and a brilliant celebration of creativity. It’s a pleasure to conjure up a little festive magic with the Pleasance in their 30th year. Local theatre is where the real wizardry happens – sparking imagination and spreading a bit of joy.” The head of theatre at Pleasance London, Ellie Simpson, said: “Jeremy’s as much a part of Islington as the Yellow Brick Road is of Oz – so who better to play the Wizard of Oz-lington? “His cameo adds a touch of local sparkle to our wickedly funny festive panto, which marks Pleasance’s first in over 20 years and raises the curtain on our 30th anniversary celebrations.” The theatre said: “This Wicked-inspired pantomime Wicked Witches – A Popular Panto! will whisk audiences down the Yellow Brick (Caledonian) Road for a gloriously camp Christmas spectacular, packed with cabaret, pop parody and plenty of laughs for those young and old alike. Expect soaring vocals, sparkly spells, and more sass than you can shake a wand at.” Corbyn sits as an independent MP after his expulsion from the Labour party shortly before the 2024 general election. He has formed a new leftwing political party – still known unofficially as Your party – with his fellow former Labour MP Zarah Sultana.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/28/jeremy-corbyn-to-appear-in-north-london-panto,Politics,2025-10-28T10:55:27Z,2
politics/2025/oct/07/keir-starmer-calls-student-protests-on-7-october-anniversary-un-british,Keir Starmer calls student protests on 7 October anniversary ‘un-British’ ,"Keir Starmer has urged students not to protest on the second anniversary of the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on Israel, describing plans for demonstrations as “un-British”. Every child of Israel should be able to live alongside their Palestinian neighbours in “safety and security”, the prime minister said as he marked the anniversary. Writing in the Times, Starmer said protests due to take place at universities on Tuesday showed a lack of respect for others. He added that the pro-Palestine protests had been used by some as a “despicable excuse to attack British Jews”. The prime minister wrote in the newspaper: “Today, on the anniversary of the atrocities of October 7, students are once again planning protests. “This is not who we are as a country. It’s un-British to have so little respect for others. And that’s before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.” Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages during an assault on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel’s subsequent offensive has so far killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health ministry. At least 460 people have died from starvation under Israel’s aid restrictions in the territory. The second anniversary of the attacks comes less than a week after Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, launched a terror attack outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, in which two people died. Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were both killed in the attack, which unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Starmer said: “Time does not diminish the evil we saw that day. The worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The brutal, cold-blooded torture and murder of Jews in their own homes. And the taking of hostages, including British citizens, some of whom remain in Gaza today.” Starmer’s message was repeated on Tuesday by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who told Sky News: “There is, of course, within our country the fundamental right to protest. It’s a cornerstone of our democracy. “But my message is that, as we remember the awful atrocities that took place two years ago on October 7, I would just encourage those considering taking part in protests to pause, to reflect and to understand the deep sense of loss that many people in our country will be experiencing today, not least given the appalling attacks we saw at Manchester last week. Thousands of people attended an event in Trafalgar Square in central London on Sunday to mark the two-year anniversary. Pro-Palestine protests also took place in the same location on Saturday, with almost 500 people arrested. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, called plans for protests in towns and cities including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol on the anniversary of the attacks “a fucking disgrace”. He told a fringe event at the Conservative party conference: “I heard today that there are protests being scheduled in universities for October 7 – that’s a fucking disgrace.” The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has said repeated large-scale demonstrations have caused “considerable fear” among the Jewish community, as she pledged to give police greater powers to restrict protests. The government will amend sections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 to explicitly allow the police to take account of the cumulative impact of frequent protests on local areas in order to impose conditions on public processions and assemblies. The home secretary is also to review existing legislation to ensure powers are sufficient and are being applied consistently by police forces. This will include powers to ban protests outright.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/07/keir-starmer-calls-student-protests-on-7-october-anniversary-un-british,Politics,2025-10-07T06:52:53Z,2
politics/2025/jul/28/donald-trump-keir-starmer-one-sided-double-act,Sidekick Starmer can’t get a word in as The Donald dominates world’s most one-sided double act,"It had been the very bestest of bigly weekends. Two rounds of golf at his very own course in Turnberry. On the Saturday Donald Trump had broken the record with a round of just 18. A hole in one at every hole. Largely because there had been men stationed about the course to pick up the ball and place it in the hole. Then on the Sunday he had gone one better. A round of 17. The ball had gone straight into the cup at the fourth hole, had rested there for a couple of seconds and then had flown out, soaring over the links and straight into the hole at the fifth. Scottie Scheffler could only dream of such a shot. So The Donald was in an expansive mood as he waited for Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, to pay him a visit on Monday morning. Which was more than could be said for the small contingent of the British press who had been sent to the South Ayrshire golf course to cover the meeting. On the table of the games room in which they had been penned, there were plates of sandwiches and biscuits. Just not for them. They were only for the US press corps. The Brits had to bring a packed lunch. Clearly, the special relationship still has a way to go. Keir and Victoria arrived at the main entrance, where Trump was waiting to greet them, along with a bagpiper who drowned out the first couple of minutes of conversation. The Donald went into overdrive. His mum was Scottish, he said several times, as if reminding himself. His attention then turned to Victoria. She was a respected person all over the US. “I don’t want to get myself into trouble,” he added, “but she’s very, she’s a great woman.” Victoria looked a little creeped out. Her husband might be a master Trump-wrangler, an expert at sycophancy and genuflection, but she wasn’t. She knew that almost no one in the US had heard of her and that’s the way she liked it. So she just tried to suck it up. She longed to get inside, away from the cameras. The Donald had other ideas, taking question after question from the gaggle of reporters gathered for the arrival. The US president is like a radio presenter on the graveyard night-time slot. Uncomfortable with silence. Filling the dead air with a long rambling stream of unconsciousness. Saying the first thing that comes into his head. Needy – greedy – for any attention he can get. No longer just the most important person in his own life but the most important person on the planet. Life doesn’t get any better than this for the supreme narcissist: he speaks and people have to suck it up and listen. Europe was in a bad place. Almost unrecognisable from the Europe of 10 years ago. Too many foreigners. He didn’t know anything about the small boat crossings, he admitted, but he was still sure they were all rapists and murderers. At this point, Starmer interrupted to say that he was very, very tough on irregular migration. Not that anyone was listening. The Donald hardly drew breath. Yes, he did think people were starving in Gaza and Israel would have to allow more aid in. He seemed to want thanks for sending food, rather than seeing it as a legal and moral obligation. Putin had disappointed him. He was going to have to rethink his 50 days. And it was time to acknowledge the six wars he had stopped. Almost one a month. There was Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Rwanda and the DRC. He couldn’t remember the others. It sounded as if he was nominating himself for the Nobel peace prize. An hour later, Trump and Starmer were gathered in the modestly named Donald J Trump Ballroom for the press conference proper. It was billed as a double act but everyone knew it wasn’t going to be that way. Keir was there purely as The Donald’s plus one. This was to be The Donald Show, with just the occasional interruption from Starmer to allow the president to draw breath. A series of rambling, self-congratulatory monologues in which we actually learned very little. We started by going over familiar territory that had already been covered in the 10-minute impromptu press conference earlier. Yes, Gaza was bad. Very bad, Keir added. So much so that he had upgraded it from “appalling but no need to do anything” to “appalling and something needs to be done”. Trump ignored him. Hamas was bad. He had always said so. Israel must do something. He didn’t say what. As for Putin, he would give him 10-12 days. This was said impulsively, on the spur of the moment, rather than as a considered news event. Then an acknowledgment to the British prime minister. He had negotiated a very good trade deal. Though it’s still not entirely clear Agent Orange understands that it’s US consumers who will pay the tariffs. Moving on. He had also just negotiated the bigliest deal in the history of the world with the EU. Starmer had just been put on notice that the UK wasn’t as important as all that. The Donald had been doing us a favour all along. The questions came from all quarters. Anything goes. Windfarms? Hate them. Ugly and expensive. What’s wrong with oil? Here, Keir tried to stand up for himself. “Actually, we like them as part of a mixed energy portfolio. Along with oil.” The Donald didn’t seem convinced and started slagging off the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. “He’s a friend of mine,” squeaked Starmer. Trump wasn’t bothered. Speak to the hand. Talking of people he didn’t like, he moved on to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Jeffrey Epstein. “I’m not a drawing kind of guy,” he said. By now, time was beginning to seriously drag. Almost 70 minutes in and no sign of an ending. The Donald moved on to how he had spent £100m on expensive plywood while renovating the golf club. The Scottish tradesmen must have seen him coming. It looks like Trump has been stiffed. So much for the art of the deal. Keir was just willing the presser to come to an end so that the talks and his confused embarrassment could be kept private. Eventually he got his wish. Trump looked as if he could have gone on for another hour and a half. Still, good to get away to his other golf course in Aberdeen. Maybe he’d complete a round in 16 there.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/28/donald-trump-keir-starmer-one-sided-double-act,Politics,2025-07-28T17:40:04Z,2
politics/2025/oct/28/reform-wheels-out-danny-kruger-brains-nigel-farage-operation,"Reform wheels out Danny Kruger, the ‘brains’ of Nigel Farage’s operation","Nigel Farage too Marmite for you? Lee Anderson too Lee Andersony? Richard Tice too smooth? Sarah Pochin a bit too racisty? Don’t worry. These things happen. But all will be well, because Reform have just the MP for you. Someone who can be passed off as a safeish pair of hands. Someone who won’t frighten the horses. Too much. Step forward Danny Kruger. Just don’t look too close into his eyes. Not even Danny knows quite who Danny really is. Sometimes you have to judge a man by the company he keeps. Kruger is the latest Reform recruit, having jumped ship from the Tories just over a month ago. Not necessarily a huge loss to Kemi Badenoch as Danny has proved time and again that his judgment is anything but infallible. But that hasn’t put him off. Because even when he’s wrong, Danny manages to convince himself that he’s right. Put simply, he’s not nearly as bright as he believes himself to be. Yet still somehow clever enough to convince Nige that he be admitted as one of the brains of the Reform operation. Since transferring his affections to Farage, Kruger has been entrusted with getting Reform policy ready for the next election. There will be no sitting around and wondering what to do next if Farage finds himself in Downing Street, because Danny will have come up with a cunning plan. Put your trust in Danny. Largely because Reform have yet to find anyone better. Somehow, Danny has convinced both himself and Nige that he knows what he’s doing. He is presented to the world as a man with experience of government. Only in reality he has none. All he has ever done is write a few speeches for David Cameron while in opposition and act as Boris Johnson’s political secretary for a couple of months in 2019. After that, nada. He has no more inside knowledge than the rest of us. What could possibly go wrong? Confused? You soon will be. No matter. For their second press conference in as many days – there’s a third due tomorrow, strictly for the masochists – Reform let Kruger loose, closely policed by Zia Yusuf. Just in case Danny was to stray off piste. More than usual, at any rate. But this was basically the Danny K show. His chance to share with the world all of the exciting thoughts he had come up with in the past six weeks now that he was freed from the demands of being a Conservative. He was feeling chipper, he began. Thrilled to be free. Reform was currently like an unruly pirate ship but give it a few years and it would be a fully functioning naval vessel. Or not. Nige has had years and years of running political parties, and they have never evolved much beyond a one-man band. But this time would be different. Reform promised to be the grownups. Serious times required serious politicians. The country was broken. And Danny should know. Because he had been a member of the party that broke it. Not that he was in the mood to apologise. Danny is very much old school. Everything is always someone else’s fault. Now for the plan. Parliament would be sovereign. Apart from the bits that wouldn’t be sovereign. Because although Reform promised to have some top-notch, cabinet-ready candidates plucked from nowhere by the next election, at least half of ministers would be Nige’s personal appointments. Too much scrutiny is a dangerous thing. As Danny knows only too well. Because he has said he would never dream of giving his Wiltshire constituents a chance to express their feelings at his recent defection. To spare them the embarrassment of re-electing him in a landslide. Sometimes you have to wonder whether he thinks before he speaks. Or whether he just thinks we’re all too stupid to care. It’s possible the stupidity is closer to home. But Kruger also had a big shake-up of the civil service in mind. It had grown 30% since Brexit. Er … yes. That’s because we no longer have EU bureaucrats to do the hard work and because there’s more admin to do. So if you want to know why the civil service is so large, Danny could look closer to home. To himself and Nige. Both architects of Brexit. The cheek is breathtaking. There was more. Reform would discontinue the leases of five Whitehall departments. That would probably be the same five departments Labour had already promised to discontinue. The idiocy levels were rising still higher. Welcome to the return of the cones hotline. Danny would set up a secret phone line to which people could ring in with stories of government waste. Please press 1 to leave a message. Your call is not important to us and we will not get back to you. Then the questions. Unsurprisingly, one of the first was about Sarah Pochin. Zia took this one, mainly because Danny had already spent 10 minutes making a fool of himself trying to explain it away on the Today programme. It is now the official Reform line to insist that Pochin is not “racist in her heart”. Just in her mouth and in her thoughts. All she was guilty of was “accidental racism”. It’s a real problem for Sarah because it keeps happening to her. Only a few months ago she was insisting that Afghans and Eritreans were more likely to be sex offenders. Imagine her pain. Loving black and brown people so much that the sight of them drives you mad. Counting them. Always counting them. Some also thought it was a bit of a cheek for Kruger to lecture us on good governance when so many Reform-led councils were a hopeless rabble. Zia insisted that in every well-run council there was a rabble waiting to be unleashed. So Reform were ahead of the game. But by now Danny was ready to go for it. Doubling down on everything. We were about to enter a new era. In which everyone would do exactly as Nige said. We would no longer be bound by international law. We would be going it alone. Pariah status, here we come. The whole DEI agenda would be scrapped. There were far too many of the wrong people in top jobs. You get his drift. He wanted a God-fearing country where children were brought up by a mother and father. Danny is not a fan of LGBTQ+. Finally we were done. More details would be revealed later. As and when he had them. The war on waste had begun. One day, Danny might even get round to taking a look at himself. A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.

politics/2025/oct/13/families-david-amess-jo-cox-voice-concern-rise-violent-political-rhetoric,Families of David Amess and Jo Cox voice concern at rise in violent political rhetoric,"The families of the murdered MPs David Amess and Jo Cox have voiced concern about a recent surge in violent political rhetoric in Britain. While the fatal attack on a synagogue in Manchester and targeting of Muslims have placed a renewed spotlight on violent antisemitism and Islamophobia, there are also concerns over an increasing normalisation of language calling for political figures to be killed. Examples include the suspension of a Reform UK councillor linked to a social media account calling for Keir Starmer to be shot and the arrest of a man allegedly captured on film at major far-right rally last month in London threatening to kill the prime minister. At the same rally, Elon Musk made comments that later drew condemnation from Downing Street when he told the crowd that “violence is coming”. The language comes after a summer of anti-immigration protests, culture war flashpoints and a surge in podcasts and YouTube videos predicting civil war. Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of her father’s death this week, Katie Amess said the murder of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk had been a triggering moment for her family but should also come as a wake-up call in the UK. “My father was someone who had just as many friends in the Labour party as in the Conservative party and worked with people from all sides, so he would be horrified at the insidious way in which dehumanising language has increasingly crept into social media,” she said. “To hear of the kinds of things that are being said and the explicit threats that are being made about political figures – including the prime minister – is deeply shocking. “We can’t bring my father back, but we can surely learn lessons and realise that it is time to dial down the temperature of what is being said both online and offline.” Brendan Cox, who was married to Jo Cox when she was shot and stabbed by a far-right extremist during the EU referendum campaign in 2016, warned high levels of polarisation and division in Britain were making violence more likely. “In the US, our nearest cultural neighbour, there is a zeitgeist of renewed political violence. We had hoped that what happened after the deaths of Jo and David, when everyone drew breath, would happen after the death of Charlie Kirk. Instead, what has happened in the US is being used as another way of stoking political division,” he said. Those on Britain’s right are also expressing concern about their safety. Nigel Farage accused Keir Starmer of inciting violence against Reform UK members by levelling accusations of racism at the party. “This language will incite and encourage the radical left,” said Farage, who has called on the police to act against TikTok users who he said had called for him to be shot. However, while the police have been quick to act in some cases, there is also concern over an apparent inconsistent approach between forces. Another stark example of the language being directed at Starmer includes footage seen by the Guardian of a far-right activist involved in protests against asylum seekers in Leicestershire calling for him to be killed on the day of the London rally. “I don’t care if I get shut down for it … I would love to see Keir Starmer get shot dead outside No 10 Downing Street … bam … straight in his head … boom … gone,” Chris Boyall told the 21,000 subscribers to his England Till I Die YouTube channel days before travelling to London. “Fucking too right … on the 13th of September it would be the perfect day for it, wouldn’t it? Shoot him fucking dead.” Leicestershire police said they were aware of the video, adding it had been reviewed thoroughly but “at this time, no criminal offence has been identified”. “We recognise the importance of balancing freedom of expression with the need to protect individuals and communities from harm,” a spokesperson said. The response was questioned by Stand Up to Racism, which highlighted the footage. “He called for the assassination of the prime minister, specified the method and said it should be done on a day he would presumably be outside the residence of the prime minister.” Cox suggested that incitement to violence may not be taken seriously by some forces who were under pressure for arresting people over non-crime hate incidents. “We don’t, and have never had, an interpretation of free speech which means you can incite violence,” he said. Concern that the acceptability of using violence could rise if those threatening it were not prosecuted was voiced by Jonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation “It’s true that counter-terrorism police will point to all their other priorities, and sometimes local policing may be enough,” he told the Guardian, adding that terrorist powers would sometimes be needed for cases of politically motivated attacks or violent threats against elected politicians. “Unless perpetrators are caught and prosecuted, there is insufficient deterrent. The acceptability of using violence to attack democratic institutions will creep up without a more consistent response.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/families-david-amess-jo-cox-voice-concern-rise-violent-political-rhetoric,Politics,2025-10-13T14:00:02Z,1
politics/2025/oct/05/kemi-badenoch-says-she-is-doing-politics-differently-you-cant-argue-with-that,Kemi Badenoch says she is ‘doing politics differently’ – you can’t argue with that,"It was time for Laura Kuenssberg to make a scene. She slammed her dressing room door and went in search of her producer. “Just who is that woman in the green room?” she asked. “She says she’s a guest on the programme.” “That must be Kemi Badenoch,” the producer replied. “Who’s she?” “She’s this year’s leader of the Tory party.” “And why am I talking to her?” said Laura. “Couldn’t we get anyone better?” “It was her or Chris Philp.” “FFS. We can’t keep filling up our show with nobodies. Our ratings will fall through the floor. The Tories are an irrelevance. They might not even exist in a few years’ time.” “But it’s their party conference. We have to look as though we’re taking them seriously. Even if no one else is.” “OK,” said Laura. “Just this once. We’ll fit her in somewhere near the end. But get me someone better next week.” Kemi was entirely oblivious to this conversation. She’s oblivious to most things. She imagines she’s a winner. Someone who can cut through the bullshit and tell people uncomfortable truths. The sharpest of minds. Hard working. If only. The reality is that Kemi has achieved the seemingly impossible: she has taken the Tories even further backwards. The 2024 general election a high point in her party’s fortunes. Her personal ratings in freefall. She and her party a mere sideshow. A curiosity. Mainly interesting for how much worse they can get. After devoting the first 40 minutes of her Sunday TV show to an interview with Shabana Mahmood, followed by a pre-record of one with two rabbis from Manchester, Kuenssberg reluctantly turned her attention to Badenoch. You could tell her heart wasn’t really in it, but she was nothing if not professional. Though there was still an undercurrent of tetchiness. This wasn’t her idea of fun. After a brief discussion of the Manchester synagogue attack, in which Kemi claimed that only the Tories had the credibility and competence to be taken seriously – Laura’s mouth opened and closed in amazement at this – on antisemitism, the conversation turned to Badenoch’s big first-day policy announcements. Deporting 150,000 people a year and leaving the European convention on human rights. “Where would the 150,000 people go?” asked Laura. “That’s the least relevant question,” replied Kemi. She has never really quite got a grip on the interview format. She still likes to think that she gets to both ask the questions and deliver the answers. That only she knows what the public really wants to hear. It’s a peculiar solipsistic variant. So it was like this. As it didn’t really matter who she deported – legal or illegal immigrants, they had all basically just come here to rape our women – it didn’t really matter where we sent them. They could go anywhere, as far as she was concerned. And if they got imprisoned or tortured on their return, then so much the better. It saved us the effort. Laura tried to point out that this wouldn’t necessarily work. What if other countries didn’t want them? But Kemi was having none of this. Foreigners would go wherever we told them to. Only the Tories had the credibility and competence. Just remember the stunning success of the Rwanda plan. She said this in all seriousness. If she could forget, then why couldn’t the rest of us? By now Kuenssberg was already on autopilot. Just willing the ordeal to be over. At one point a little banner was put up on the screen – “Kemi Badenoch: leader of the Conservative party”. To help all those who were struggling to understand why we were being put through this. Laura looked at her notes. Perhaps we could talk about the ECHR. Did Kemi really want to join Russia and Belarus as the only countries not to be signed up? Badenoch nodded eagerly. Neither the US nor Canada were signatories. It rapidly dawned on Laura that she was dealing with an idiot. Er … the US and Canada were not in Europe. The clue was in the title. Kemi wasn’t backing down. The US and Canada could have been European if they had wanted to be. In any case, Italy was trying to change the ECHR. Er … That was different from leaving it. We never did get round to discussing the Good Friday agreement. The Tories were never going to out-Reform Reform, Kuenssberg pointed out. But all her party had managed to do in the past year or so was to play catch-up. There was no coherence to anything. No sense the Conservatives had understood how badly they had failed during their 14 years in government. That the country was still waiting for some kind of acknowledgment. If an apology was off the cards. “I am doing politics differently,” Kemi said defiantly. You can’t argue with that. Tin-eared, tone-deaf. A determination to learn nothing. A residual belief that sooner or later the country would fall in love with the Tories again, without the party needing to change. All it required was sitting tight and waiting out the tricky patch. Or maybe Kemi is a sleeper agent. Determined to destroy the Tories from within. When you’ve eliminated all that is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. There was the same sense of existential futility inside the conference hall. The place was like a ghost town. The bars and stands empty. As if no one had cared enough to come, apart from those who were contractually obliged to be there. A place where the Tory party had come to witness its own extinction. The conference highlights were ghosts of the past. Some Margaret Thatcher mementoes and a Winston Churchill AI. The Times columnist and Tory arriviste Matthew Syed tried to galvanise the room. Now was the time for some penitence, which is why Kemi was the only possible leader. Hmm. It’s possible he’s never met Kemi. Either way, it was a curiously flat Kemi who later gave the first of her two conference speeches on the main stage. She seemed bemused by the Autocue, bemused by the lack of energy in the room, bemused by her own speech. She didn’t even seem to realise she had finished. There again, even by her own standards it had been incoherent. The triumph of the Conservative years. The fightback started now. Leave the ECHR. “We can win the next election,” Kemi insisted. Not even a very sweaty Chris Philp looked as if he believed that. It’s going to be a long four days.

politics/2025/oct/02/nadine-dorries-is-back-with-her-incisive-thinking-and-deranged-conspiracy-theories,Nadine Dorries is back – with her incisive thinking and deranged conspiracy theories,"Be careful what you wish for. Danny Kruger was already looking very queasy when he sat at the back for the Reform press conference in which Nigel Farage revealed his plans for mass deportations of legal migrants. Then on Wednesday it fell to him to go on television to say that when Zia Yusuf had repeatedly said Keir Starmer was a terrorist who was plotting to kill Farage, he had actually meant something entirely different. Fair to say Danny probably isn’t living his best Reform life. It’s one thing to defect from the Tories. It’s another to be made to look a quarter-wit in the process. Nadine Dorries, though, is another matter. She really is living the dream. Maybe it helps that she was never that bright in the first place but she is a woman of no regrets. Perfectly happy to live in the day. The past isn’t just another country, it’s a parallel universe. One where any inconsistencies and inconvenient truths are consigned to blissful oblivion. She is the unthinking woman’s unthinking woman. A danger to herself but a source of amusement to the rest of us. We last saw Nad on the day of her defection at the Reform party conference in early September. There she had been brought on stage to introduce herself. Fair to say this was not one of her finest performances. She appeared – and there is no kind way of saying this – rambling and totally incoherent. So much so that Nige had to make an unscheduled appearance on stage to interrupt her and drag her away. Her final words were: “You’ll never take me alive.” Or something like that. But Dorries is now back, giving an interview to Cathy Newman on Channel 4’s Fourcast podcast. And not a moment too soon. Politics has missed her incisive thinking and deranged conspiracy theories. We dived straight in with the accusations of racism. Nad nodded her head seriously. She had had time to consider Reform’s policies in great depth – always a warning sign when Nad says something like that – and come to the conclusion that Reform couldn’t be racist because everyone in Reform was too intelligent to be racist. Newman pointed out that deporting people with a legal right to be here probably was racist. Now Nad went rogue. She had worked in the NHS and some of her best friends had been Filipinos and Reform wasn’t going to deport all of them – she might want to check this one out with Nige – but it was fine to chuck out all those who were here illegally, which made up for most hospital workers. At which point it slowly dawned on Cathy that Nadine didn’t seem to quite understand the difference between legal and illegal. We moved on to the prime minister’s speech to the Labour conference. Here Nad went full Zia. It had definitely been an incitement to murder. Keir wanted Nige dead. Dan Brown had told her so, personally. Along with saying he thought she was the greatest living novelist. It was perfectly normal for the head of government to order executions on live TV. All of them had done that. Apart from her darling Boris. Nad didn’t seem to remember that Reform had publicly backed Lucy Connolly who actually had incited violence. Now things became steadily more unhinged. Nige and Zia’s “Boriswave” had actually been a secret invention of Dominic Cummings. Yet another cog in the endless plot to bring down Boris. She knew this because she had had a conversation about it with Boris, though she couldn’t discuss any of her private conversations with her Bozzy bear. It was only a matter of time before she blamed Michael Gove. “Why don’t people blame Rishi Sunak for the increase in immigration?” Dorries pleaded. Er … possibly because it all started under Boris. And come to think of it, why hadn’t Nadine said something about it when she was in Johnson’s cabinet? That was because no one had told her all these people were coming into the country and it hadn’t occurred to her to ask. She had been too busy enjoying the Brexit benefits of controlling our borders by letting 4.2 million people in. She demanded another moment’s silence for Boris. The finest PM to have ever lived. Then the bombshell. “I’ve given my life to politics and I have a lot of wisdom,” she said. Something no one has ever said of Dorries. Or is ever likely to. There were dozens of Tory MPs queueing up to defect to Reform. But Nige was only interested in taking the very brightest and the best. People of the calibre of … Nadine. Who wouldn’t welcome someone this gifted? There was just time for one more jewel. A searing insight. No one could possibly have guessed that Reform’s health policy consultant Aseem Malhotra would use his conference speech to blame the king’s cancer on the Covid jab, because it was not as if he had ever said anything like that before. Oh, he had. Reform took only the finest minds of their generation. And if a peerage were to come her way … She was getting ahead of herself. It’s only a matter of time. “I hate doing media,” Nad concluded. She hides it well. If Nad was having a top day out, Mark Rowley, the head of the Met, was having one of his worst as he was made to do a series of interviews explaining away the latest exposé from the BBC’s Panorama programme. Rowley looked as if he would rather be almost anywhere else. Even spending an hour with Nadine. That bad. It was like this. The Met wasn’t institutionally racist, misogynistic and violent, he said. It was just that the Beeb had managed to root out the five or six bad apples in the entire force. Everyone else was above reproach. People could have full confidence in the police. And no, he wasn’t going to resign. Because what would be the point? Whoever took over from him would only then have to resign the next time it happened. Then where would we be? Far better that no one took responsibility. Would that do? It would have to. The Bonfire of the Insanities by John Crace (Guardian Faber Publishing, £16.99).

politics/2025/sep/05/such-a-vibrant-feeling-reform-uk-devotees-gather-party-conference,‘Such a vibrant feeling’: Reform UK devotees gather at party conference,"Wrapped in a union flag and clad head to foot in red, white and blue as she took in the full spectacle of Reform UK’s conference, Kim Anderson was enjoying meeting like-minded Nigel Farage supporters in the flesh. “If you were ask me if politics is a big part of my life I would say it is and it isn’t, but I can spend all day commenting on the GB News website. You find that if you say things in a certain way then you can say anything you like,” said Anderson, a retired former ambulance worker and one-time Labour voter who had enthusiastically now thrown her lot in with Reform. In Hethersett, near Norwich, where she lives, Anderson spoke of having to be cautious about expressing her views, adding: “You can normally judge what people are going to say, but you do have to watch what you say, you can find yourself shut down or they walk away.” Not so at this year’s conference, where hostility to the “woke agenda”, immigration and the hated “uniparty” – Reform parlance for the Conservatives and Labour – was the order of the day. Party conference season has kicked off at a time when Nigel Farage’s organisation is enjoying as much as a 15-point lead over Labour. The numbers suggest it is gaining traction from new voters with a diversity of views, but the fervour of the Reform faithful was often as unfiltered as ever. In the main hall of Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre, an 85-year-old party supporter holding two St George’s cross flags let fly as he was interviewed by Jeremy Kyle on a big screen. Worried he was going to die before Farage becomes prime minister, he turned his fire on Keir Starmer. “I can’t wait to get this bastard out,” he shouted, to the biggest cheer of the day from audience. Others found Kyle’s jokes just as entertaining. “Has anyone noticed how Rachel from accounts looks startlingly like Richard III,” he said, using pejorative rightwing shorthand for Rachel Reeves, the chancellor. Elsewhere, Terry Washington, 47, from London was at pains to insist he was “not tribal” but spoke in evangelical tones about his conversion to Reform, for which he was now considering running as a candidate. Washington, a former Vodafone worker who was an executive at a carpet firm, described himself as “socially liberal” and “fiscally conservative”. He was among dozens who had invested in light blue Reform UK football shirts, more often than not with the choice of “Farage” and the number 10 on the back. While an admirer of Farage, the “can do” language of Reform’s chair, Zia Yusuf, had also been a draw. “I’m from the corporate world and we get things done and I think Zia is one of those guys, too, even if it means we are not always popular,” said Washington, who bought his Reform football shirt two weeks ago and estimated that he had given the party hundreds of pounds. Elsewhere, sporting a “Make Britain Great Again” cap, William Payne rattled off what he described as the “burning priorities” to save Britain, ranging from rolling back attacks on freedom of speech to ensuring that the borders were firmly and securely shut. “There’s a unity of purpose here and it’s just really refreshing to come up and actually see that there is a plan to save this country. Reform UK is the only hope.” Kieran Mishchuk, an 18-year-old who won Reform UK’s first seat on Swale borough council, had got out of bed before 7am to travel to the conference, where he was planning to collect as many autographs as possible from senior Reform figures. “It’s just such a vibrant feeling being here, where everyone really is open to ideas and they’re excited about the future,” said Mishchuk. He said that he “worked well” alongside his Labour counterparts but insisted that radical change was needed at a local and national level. “This is the next step in terms of fixing our country. That’s why people are here. We realise that something drastic needs to be done to save our culture.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/such-a-vibrant-feeling-reform-uk-devotees-gather-party-conference,Politics,2025-09-05T17:36:00Z,1
politics/2025/sep/03/a-class-act-tim-allan-the-former-blair-smoother-recalled-to-downing-street,"‘A class act’: Tim Allan, the former Blair ‘smoother’ recalled to Downing Street","Tim Allan once acknowledged that under Tony Blair’s No 10 press operation it was a mistake that “spin doctors became the story”. Now he is returning to Downing Street more than 25 years later at the request of Keir Starmer, and will be hoping to avoid that destiny that so many political press chiefs – from Alastair Campbell and Steve Hilton to Fiona Hill and Dominic Cummings – have faced. A former deputy press secretary under Blair, Allan is a smooth and impeccably well-connected PR man, according to those who have worked with him. But he has a job on his hands to turn around Downing Street’s faltering communications efforts, which are struggling to cut through against Nigel Farage’s noisy populism. He will also have to deal with criticism over his previous clients. Some No 10 insiders resisted his appointment on the grounds that his former communications company, Portland, took on work to help improve the Kremlin’s image. There is further potential for controversy over his role as a trustee for the gender critical Sex Matters charity, which he resigned to take on the No 10 job. Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, wrote to Starmer this week objecting to Allan’s role and questioning whether Sex Matters would get undue influence in government. A friend of Allan’s said it would be ministers, not the director of communications, who decided policy. Those who have worked with Allan, 55, believe he will have no problem riding out any criticism and getting on with what he has been hired to do: bringing some political communications heft into the room in the same way that another former Blair adviser, Jonathan Powell, has taken a lead on foreign affairs. Allan has a long history with the party, having moved in the same New Labour circles as the former cabinet ministers David Miliband and James Purnell in the 1990s. Senior party figures said his annual Christmas party had for many years been the hot ticket of the festive season and that “everyone who is anyone is invited from the political world of Labour”. A 1994 Observer article describes Allan, along with Alastair Campbell, as one of “Tony’s smoothers: smart media-orientated Oxbridge thirty-something helpers”. The Cambridge graduate was, however, only 24 at the time, having joined Blair’s team after a stint in the media on Channel 4’s Week in Politics. A deputy press secretary to Blair from 1994 to 1998 under Alastair Campbell, he was also the captain of the No 10 football team. Allan was well respected in the job but left after just a year in Downing Street to take a job as an adviser to Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB, prompting a debate in parliament over the so-called revolving door with the media operator. A few years later, while still an adviser to BSkyB, Allan wrote for the Spectator arguing against the influence of the BBC in Downing Street, calling it a “world-class rip-off, robbing the poor to provide for the rich, and it should not be allowed to expand still further”. He founded Portland, a corporate and financial PR company, in 2001 and sold it to Omnicom with revenue of about £40m nearly two decades later. Former Portland clients ranged from Heathrow to William Hill and the governments of Kazakhstan and Qatar. Portland also had a controversial sub-contract through other PR companies to help improve the image of the Russian government and monitor its media presence from 2005 until Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. Those who have worked for the agency said it was a different time when western governments were trying to bring Vladimir Putin onside and that the UK government had been fully aware of its work. Allan has since chaired another consultancy firm, Strand Partners, which has lobbied for gas industry clients among others. He stepped down as a director in May. One friend of Allan’s from the world of PR described him as “inscrutable and smart” and “very self-deprecating”. Former Portland staffers were also positive about his management style. One said he had a “no assholes” policy and was not a Malcolm Tucker-style political adviser. Some within No 10 are still wary though, having worked through several different communications chiefs in recent years. One senior Labour source said: “Can’t wait for the Tories to start looking at Portland’s lobbying for the Russian government.” A minister said: “I’m not sure what Tim Allan and David Dinsmore [the former Sun editor appointed as a civil service communications chief] have to teach us about the modern media. Is this as dynamic as it gets?” One person who has known and worked with Allan for decades, however, said Starmer had picked right this time and that Allan was an “exceptionally good operator” who would bring people together rather than cause divisions. “You don’t found and build up a big company like Portland without a lot of talent,” they said. Another said Allan was “not an ideological” appointment. “He’s raised the level of human capital inside No 10 and Tim is a class act,” he said, and that his task would be to convey to the public what the prime minister really believes.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/03/a-class-act-tim-allan-the-former-blair-smoother-recalled-to-downing-street,Politics,2025-09-03T04:01:12Z,1
politics/2025/aug/13/david-lammy-watchdog-illegal-fishing-without-license-jd-vance,Lammy refers himself to watchdog after fishing illegally with JD Vance,"David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog after going fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during the US vice-president’s trip to the UK. The foreign secretary hosted Vance and his family at Chevening House in Kent last week, where the pair fished from the property’s private lake. Anglers aged 13 and over must hold a rod licence to fish for freshwater species such as carp in England and Wales. Lammy failed to land a catch, but “all of my kids did”, Vance said. The Foreign Office said an “administrative oversight” meant licences had not been obtained in advance. Lammy bought them as soon as he was made aware, and wrote to the Environment Agency to acknowledge the breach. “He also thanked them for their work protecting Britain’s fisheries,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said. The agency confirmed the licences had since been bought. All fish caught during the visit were returned to the water. The fishing trip formed part of a wider UK tour by Vance, who was on holiday in the Cotswolds with his wife, Usha, and three children. The visit has combined family time with private political meetings and a heavy security presence in the normally quiet Oxfordshire countryside. Vance’s stay at Dean Manor, an 18th-century Georgian home, reportedly arranged by the former chancellor George Osborne, led to road closures, police checkpoints and the installation of a temporary helipad. Pippa and Johnny Hornby, who own the property, later apologised to residents for the “circus” caused by the vice-president’s security detail. Protesters from the Stop Trump Coalition held a “Vance not welcome” party in nearby Charlbury, attended by about 100 people carrying placards and cakes mocking the Republican politician. Some slogans took aim at Vance’s record on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. On Wednesday evening, Vance was greeted by dozens of pro-Palestine protesters bashing pots and pans as he arrived at the luxury Carnell Estate near Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire. Vance has held informal talks with senior Conservatives, including the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp. He also attended a breakfast with Nigel Farage. According to US and UK officials, discussions with Lammy covered Ukraine, Gaza, trade and concerns from Washington about aspects of UK legislation, including the Online Safety Act.

politics/2025/jul/09/another-mediocre-stalemate-at-pmqs-as-neither-kemi-nor-keir-bother-to-engage,Rachel Reeves is the only one grinning wildly at Keir and Kemi’s dreary display,"Spare a thought for Rachel Reeves. After last week’s mini-meltdown during prime minister’s questions, the chancellor is now condemned to spend the next year grinning manically every time she’s out and about in public. Having a bad day at the office? GRIN. Had a row with the kids? GRIN. Now there is no escape. To make it worse, you now get endless colleagues patting you on the shoulder and looking you deep in the eyes as they ask if you’re OK. When you just want to be left alone. GRIN. Everything is fine. Couldn’t be more normal. Sometimes, it’s no fun being a politician. So Rachel entered the Commons alongside Keir Starmer for this week’s PMQs grinning wildly. Of course she did. And it must have taken all Kemi Badenoch’s self-control not to have made fun of the chancellor. She might know it’s a bad look for a party leader to use someone’s mental health against them, but generally speaking she can’t help herself. Kemi is hardwired to kick an opponent when she’s down. But well done Kemi for doing the right thing. Unfortunately for her that was about the only thing she did get right. Not that Starmer himself was on sparkling form. The chaos of the welfare bill has clearly ground him down. It was more that Kemi felt a bit distracted herself. As though her heart wasn’t fully in it either. Semi-detached Kemi. This PMQs was just another chore to be ticked off the list. One to forget for all concerned. “Labour said there would be no more rises in income tax, personal national insurance and VAT,” she began. “Is that a promise you intend to keep?” “Yes,” replied Starmer, before sitting straight down again. One down, five to go. Kemi seemed surprised by the brevity and raced back to her notes. Not a good idea. Because her next move was to accuse Starmer of giving in to the resident doctors. Keir looked understandably confused. Largely because he hasn’t given in. The government and the doctors are in a standoff. Kemi had another go. Back to tax. Was Labour going to freeze the tax thresholds yet again? This wasn’t quite the slam dunk she thought it was. Partly because no prime minister is going to write a budget in advance, but mainly because there is no one in the country who ever imagined that Labour was going to raise the thresholds. The Tories hadn’t done so for years and had committed themselves to maintaining the freeze had they won the last election. So this was hardly a big reveal. Every government in recent years has counted on fiscal drag to balance the books. At this point, Starmer went to his own default setting and accused Badenoch of talking the country down. Which would have been music to Emmanuel Macron, who is over in the UK for a state visit. The French president is desperate for the UK to reduce the pull factor for migrants coming to this country. So what more could he ask for than Kemi to tell everyone how rubbish things really were? “Don’t come here. Nothing works. We’re all ever more broke than you.” She could empty the beaches in northern France in minutes. Kemi now turned to a wealth tax. “This is something that will affect all our constituents,” she said. Er … hello? Unless I’m missing something, the proposed wealth tax only comes into effect on people with assets in excess of £10m. Which, by my reckoning, rather excludes most constituents. Though perhaps Kemi knows something the rest of us don’t. Maybe Saffron Walden is wall-to-wall multimillionaires. But here’s something Kemi definitely doesn’t know. A wealth tax is actually quite popular with most voters. They like the idea of the super-rich paying a bit more. Even if Tory donors don’t. We ended the leaders clash where we so often do on days like these where neither Kemi nor Keir can really be bothered to engage. In an unsatisfactory stalemate. Kemi claiming the Tories had left the country with a booming economy – she still hasn’t worked out why her party only won 121 seats at the last election – and everything was now shit. Keir insisting everything had been shit and that the good times were back again. I couldn’t help feeling that both their good times had rather passed me by. I must have been asleep. At times, it feels as if no party is prepared to grasp the demographic realities of the fiscal situation. Sitting near the back during these exchanges were Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock. A new two-man party of the Reform Recovery Group. Cast adrift by Nigel Farage. Left to contemplate their inner futility. Though it’s possible James has other things on his mind. At present he finds himself in hot water over Covid loans. Labour’s John Slinger was not going to let McMurdock’s appearance in the Commons go unremarked. Was it not the case that anyone who was guilty of extracting Covid loans under false pretences should feel the full force of the law? Or perhaps under Lord Leveson’s recommendations, 40% of the force of the law. Starmer needed no second invitation. There was “no place for con artists and grifters in public life”. Cue the speaker. Lindsay Hoyle may be a bit of a bore at heart, more interested in securing himself a peerage than the day job, but he is occasionally capable of genius comic timing. All the better for probably being accidental. Because a nanosecond after Starmer had talked of con artists and grifters, he chose to introduce Nigel Farage. Not that anyone got to properly hear Nige amid first the general laughter and then the barracking. Poor Lee Anderson became quite overwhelmed that his leader was not getting heard and demanded that the independent MP Iqbal Mohamed shut up. The noise wasn’t a great look. Nige thrives on being the voice of the people, the man whom the establishment want to silence. Sometimes, Westminster does Nige’s job for him. But what Farage had seemed to say was that he didn’t want anyone slagging off Brexit. It had been a great idea, was still a great idea even though it was a disaster, and could he tell Macron to sink a few more boats and stop being so arrogant. What is it with Nige and Manu? A secret love tryst gone wrong? Macron seems to live rent free in Nige’s head. Despite slagging him off at every opportunity, Nige is desperate to meet him. And can’t believe it when Manu says no. He doesn’t like it when Nige talks dirty … This one will run and run.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/09/another-mediocre-stalemate-at-pmqs-as-neither-kemi-nor-keir-bother-to-engage,Politics,2025-07-09T16:11:54Z,1
politics/2025/jun/15/keir-starmer-in-diplomatic-push-to-head-off-middle-east-crisis-ahead-of-g7-summit-in-canada,Keir Starmer in diplomatic push to head off Middle East crisis before G7 summit in Canada,"Keir Starmer is beginning an urgent diplomatic push to try to head off the crisis in the Middle East, as the Foreign Office warned Britons not to travel to Israel after further retaliatory attacks by Iran. Downing Street did not rule out the possibility of having to evacuate UK nationals from Israel if matters deteriorated, saying officials were keeping all contingency plans “under constant review”. The prime minister discussed the continuing clashes between Israel and Iran with the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in Ottawa before heading to the G7 summit in Kananaskis, in the western province of Alberta. While Starmer’s programme for meetings at the summit has yet to be set out, it is likely he will hold bilateral talks with leaders such as President Donald Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, all of whom Starmer has talked to by phone since the strikes began. “Our priorities, as we’ve repeatedly said, is de-escalation,” Starmer’s deputy spokesperson told reporters in the Canadian capital, before the prime minister met Carney for talks. On Saturday evening, the pair held an informal meeting before watching the Stanley Cup ice hockey final on TV in an Ottawa bar. “That is what we’re concentrating on and encouraging in our discussions with international partners.” Asked what Starmer could do at the G7, he added: “Clearly, the Middle East will be a topic of discussion, and will be this afternoon in the bilateral with prime minister Carney, but we’ve been clear throughout that the only route to peace is through diplomacy and through de-escalation.” Earlier on Sunday, the Foreign Office warned Britons against travel to Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories, one of the UK government’s most severe warnings in recent memory. The updated guidance warned that insurance policies may be invalidated, describing the crisis as a “fast-moving situation” posing “significant risks”. It marks the biggest escalation of UK travel advice since October 2023, when the government urged citizens to avoid all but essential travel after the Hamas attacks of 7 October. Sunday’s blanket warning goes further still, reflecting the growing threat to foreign nationals as tensions between Israel and Iran boil over into open confrontation. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, during the flight to Canada, Starmer refused to rule out defending Israel from Iranian strikes launched in response to Israel’s attack against Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, despite Tehran’s threat that such an action could lead to British bases in the region being targeted. Speaking earlier to Sky News, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said that while the UK had sent additional RAF Typhoon jets and refuelling aircraft to the region, this was just a “precautionary” move. “It does not mean that we are at war,” she said. Reeves noted the UK has in the past helped intercept missiles heading towards Israel, and said similar defensive action could not be ruled out. “We have in the past supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in,” she said, adding that the government would act to protect British assets and potentially support its allies. Asked if the UK would back Israel if it seemingly wanted to go further than degrading Iran’s nuclear capabilities, with strikes intended to push for regime change in Tehran, the No 10 spokesperson said not. “We have always been clear Israel must abide by international law, but more broadly, as I say, we’ve always supported Israel’s right to self-defence and its right to protect its citizens,” he said. “Top of our priorities, we’ve repeatedly said, is de-escalation. That is what we’re concentrating on and encouraging in our discussions with international partners.” Israel’s ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, said on Sunday that “Europe owes a huge thank you” for Israel’s strike on Iranian nuclear infrastructure. She called the operation an act of self-defence, insisting Iran had rejected diplomatic overtures. “Our region would have been a place that is not safe for anyone if Iran had accomplished their plan,” she told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. Over the weekend, Iranian missiles struck civilian areas of Israel, including the coastal city of Bat Yam, killing at least 13 people. In retaliation, Israel launched strikes deep into Iranian territory, including sites linked to the Revolutionary Guard and the country’s South Pars gas field. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has threatened a “more decisive and severe” response if Israeli strikes continue. The nation’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, accused Israel of attempting to drag the war into the Persian Gulf, and warned the conflict could spread further if not contained. Araghchi also claimed Israel’s actions were designed to sabotage nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, and alleged they could not have happened “without the US green light and support”. With oil prices rising and regional instability worsening, governments in the west are facing pressure to both contain the violence and protect critical energy routes. While in Ottawa on Sunday, Starmer spoke to the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE is a potentially significant player in any moves to calm down the conflict. In March, the emirate was the intermediary used to deliver a letter to Tehran from Trump suggesting negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/15/keir-starmer-in-diplomatic-push-to-head-off-middle-east-crisis-ahead-of-g7-summit-in-canada,Politics,2025-06-15T15:10:59Z,1
politics/2025/oct/17/three-uk-neo-nazis-jailed-for-between-eight-and-11-years-over-terror-plots,Three neo-Nazis jailed for plotting terror attacks on UK mosques and synagogues,"Three neo-Nazi extremists who amassed an arsenal of more than 200 weapons and were planning terrorist attacks on mosques and synagogues in England have been jailed for between eight and 11 years. Christopher Ringrose, 35, Marco Pitzettu, 26, and Brogan Stewart, 25, communicated online and formed a group with “like-minded extremists” who wanted to “go to war for their chosen cause”, a jury heard. A nine-week trial at Sheffield crown court heard how the trio idolised Hitler and the Nazis, used racist slurs, glorified mass murderers and encouraged violence against anyone deemed an enemy. The three men, who were not believed to have met in person until they appeared together in the dock, were arrested when security services believed an attack was imminent. It came after undercover officers infiltrated their online group. A jury rejected defence claims that the men were fantasists with no intention of carrying out their threats. On Friday, a high court judge, Ms Justice Cutts, jailed Stewart for 11 years, Ringrose for 10 years and Pitzettu for eight years. She said she believed all three men continued to adhere to their extreme rightwing ideology. At the two-day sentencing hearing, the prosecutor, Jonathan Sandiford KC, said the three defendants were “followers of an extreme rightwing Nazi ideology”. He said: “They justified, encouraged and glorified serious violence against and killing of persons of other races [who were] effectively seen as inferior and unworthy of human dignity or indeed life. “On more than one occasion, each of the defendants expressed hatred for and desire and willingness to engage in serious violence against people they perceived as enemies of their cause.” Sandiford said they each showed an interest in material depicting mass killings and by 2024 had acquired a large cache of weapons capable of inflicting serious violence. The trial heard that the arsenal included machetes, hunting knives, swords, axes, crossbows, body armour, a stun gun and a baseball bat. Ringrose had also 3D-printed most of the components of a semi-automatic firearm at the time of his arrest and was trying to obtain the remaining parts. Sandiford said the men were actively seeking to acquire more deadly weapons, including improvised explosives. The men, believing a race war was imminent, discussed targets for harassment and attacks, including mosques, Islamic education centres and synagogues. The trial heard they identified an Islamic centre in Leeds to attack and discussed abducting and torturing an imam, the route they would take, how they would avoid detection and their escape. Stewart styled himself as the “Führer” and laid down uniform rules for members to be dressed in Nazi-style clothing. He called the group Einsatz 14, referencing Nazi paramilitary death squads, and appointed Pitzettu and Ringrose as “armourers”. An undercover officer called Blackheart was appointed as the “Obergruppenführer” in the group, jurors heard. During the trial, Sandiford said that when Blackheart asked Stewart about the group’s ideology, the defendant replied: “Personally, I’ve taken inspiration from the SS” adding, “I also hope that we can extort political rivals and potentially plan operations to meet migrants landing on our beaches and deal with them. As the race war comes to unfold, I’d expect members to stand by, wait for orders and deploy to combat.” Ringrose, of Cannock, Pitzettu, of Derby, and Stewart, of Tingley, West Yorkshire, were found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism and of charges of collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism. Ringrose was also convicted of manufacturing a prohibited weapon. Pitzettu pleaded guilty to obtaining an illegal stun gun at a previous hearing. After the sentencing, the head of counter-terrorism policing north east, DCS James Dunkerley, said: “Stewart, Pitzettu and Ringrose have rightfully been convicted of multiple terrorism offences, and I welcome their sentence today. They were a group that espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme rightwing mindset. “Some of their defence in court was that it was all fantasy or just part of harmless chat. However, all three took real-world steps to plan and prepare for carrying out an attack on innocent citizens.” Bethan David, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s counter-terrorism division, said: “These extremists were plotting violent acts of terrorism against synagogues, mosques and an Islamic education centre. By their own admission, they were inspired by SS tactics and supremacist ideology. “Had Christopher Ringrose managed to completely finish building the 3D printed semi-automatic firearm that he had started to, it could have been used leading to devastating consequences.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/17/three-uk-neo-nazis-jailed-for-between-eight-and-11-years-over-terror-plots,Politics,2025-10-17T12:31:05Z,0
politics/2025/sep/01/politicians-urge-badenoch-to-come-clean-after-doubts-cast-on-us-medical-school-claim,Badenoch urged to ‘come clean’ after doubt cast on Stanford University claim,"Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for Kemi Badenoch to come clean about her claims of an offer from Stanford University at the age of 16, after former admissions staff said she had described an impossible scenario. The Labour MP Peter Prinsley has written to the Conservatives leader saying she should lay out the specifics of how the alleged offer came about, given the doubts cast over her story. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said Badenoch risked undermining trust. Badenoch has defended her claim to have received an offer as a teenager in Nigeria from the elite university to study medicine, sometimes described by her as pre-med, even though the university does not offer that course for undergraduates. Admissions staff have also said the Conservative leader’s assertion she was offered a place on exam results alone, and was offered a partial scholarship, would not have been possible, with no offers made on that basis. Jon Reider, the admissions officer during the period Badenoch applied, told the Guardian he had been responsible for international admissions and scholarships and had not offered one to Badenoch. Badenoch doubled down on Monday, telling reporters she had indeed received offers based on her exam results. “All I will say is that I remember the very day those letters came to me. It was not just from Stanford. I was 16, I had done very well in my SATs,” she said. “But this is 30 years ago, I don’t have the papers, and what the Guardian is doing is reporting on hearsay rather than talking about what the government is doing.” Multiple former admissions staff and US academics have told the Guardian that Stanford has never made offers based only on SATs – US standardised tests – with no exceptions even for royalty or child prodigies. Prinsley, a former hospital consultant, wrote to Badenoch to say her claims have been “called into serious question by people in a position to understand the situation, and I would be grateful if you could demonstrate that you have been telling the truth”. He said the Tory leader should clear up whether she had applied to Stanford and whether a place and financial aid had been offered. A Labour source said: “Honesty and integrity aren’t optional qualities for those who serve as the leader of His Majesty’s official opposition. The uncertainty surrounding Kemi Badenoch’s Stanford University claims raises important questions that the public deserve to know the answers to. “Badenoch needs to come clean about what’s happened here and whether she’s been telling the truth to the British people.” Wilson also wrote to Badenoch saying she should come clean. “If Kemi Badenoch cares about restoring trust, she should start by explaining her own academic record,” she said. “Failing to come clean over these allegations would send a message to the thousands of pupils who just received their exam results that their hard work does not matter and that you can just bluff your way to the top.”",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/01/politicians-urge-badenoch-to-come-clean-after-doubts-cast-on-us-medical-school-claim,Politics,2025-09-01T17:06:15Z,0
politics/2025/aug/31/doubts-cast-on-kemi-badenochs-claim-of-us-medical-school-offer,Doubts cast on Kemi Badenoch’s claim of US medical school offer,"Doubts have surfaced over Kemi Badenoch’s claim to have been offered a place at a prestigious US medical school at 16, with admissions staff unable to recall the proposal and the university not providing the course. The Conservative leader has said in interviews that she was offered a place and a partial scholarship to study medicine – sometimes describing it as pre-medicine – at Stanford University in California, one of the most competitive in the US. However, medicine is only offered to graduates at Stanford and there is no pre-med degree. When asked for clarification, the Conservatives then said Badenoch had not applied but had been offered the place by a number of US universities – including Stanford – on the basis of good exam results in US standardised tests. But academic and admissions experts have cast doubt on this, saying it was an impossible scenario. Jon Reider, the Stanford admissions officer at the time of Badenoch’s application who was responsible for international students and the allocation of bursaries, said he would have been responsible for offering Badenoch a place and had not done so. Badenoch moved to the UK from Nigeria aged 16. “Although 30 years have passed, I would definitely remember if we had admitted a Nigerian student with any financial aid. The answer is that we did not do so,” he said. Reider said he had admitted a few students based in Africa during that period but not from Nigeria. “I assure you that we would not have admitted a student based on test scores alone, nor would we have mailed an invitation to apply to any overseas students based on test scores,” he said. He added: “O-levels would not have been sufficient, and we would have been very nervous admitting a 16-year-old. She would have had to have an extraordinary record.” Reider also revealed it was implausible for a student to be offered a partial scholarship they could not afford to take up. “If an applicant needed, say, $30,000 a year to attend Stanford, we would offer them the full amount. There was no point in offering them less because they would not have been able to attend. If we admitted them, we wanted them to enrol,” he said. “We were very generous and could offer only about 30 full scholarships a year. Some turned us down for Harvard, Yale. I made the selections myself, subject to the approval of the dean. I was never overruled by any of the three deans for whom I worked.” The Guardian has also consulted Ivy League admissions coaches, an author specialising in college admissions, several Stanford graduates and an Ivy League vice-provost. All of those who spoke to the Guardian said they did not believe it was plausible for a place to be offered proactively on exam results alone. One senior US academic said he had never heard of any exemptions – not even for internationally renowned child prodigies or royalty. Badenoch first mentioned her admission to Stanford in an interview with the Huffington Post in 2017, when she had just been elected as the Conservative MP for Saffron Walden. Asked what she wanted to be when she was 16, she said: “A doctor, like my parents. Going to a very bad school here stopped me. I had actually got admission into medical school in the US – I got into Stanford pre-med – and I got into medical school in Nigeria but I came here because being a citizen, it was just a lot cheaper.” Additional detail was given in an interview with the Times in 2024. The interview says: “At 16, her US SAT scores won her a partial pre-med scholarship to Stanford, but her family still couldn’t afford the place.” The claim that Badenoch had an early offer from Stanford has been mentioned in numerous other newspaper articles. In a profile in the Spectator in 2020, it says Badenoch “won a part-scholarship to Stanford University to study medicine”. The same claim is made in a profile in the Daily Mail by Lord Ashcroft last year, previewing his biography of Badenoch. On its website, the university says: “Stanford does not have a pre-med major. For any of the health professions, you may major in any discipline.” Medicine is a graduate degree. A Conservative party source said it was a common colloquialism to refer to taking a science undergraduate degree as “pre-med” and that Badenoch was using this terminology having spent time in the US. After further questions, the Conservative party said Badenoch had not in fact applied directly to Stanford but had received a number of offers from US, UK and Nigerian universities – including Stanford – when she received good SAT results. A spokesperson for Badenoch said: “Nearly 30 years ago, and aged 16, Kemi was offered a part-scholarship at Stanford that her parents couldn’t afford to take up. “But, given her subsequent degrees in both engineering and law are a matter of public record, she questions the hysterical efforts to disprove this, from people who showed little interest in probing Rachel Reeves’s hole-filled CV that has contributed to the economic crisis engulfing our country.” Irena Smith, another former Stanford admissions officer who began there in 1999 and authored the memoir The Golden Ticket, said: “Based on my experience, students with high SAT scores might have been encouraged to apply, but would not have received an offer of admission without completing an application, which would include a list of their activities, teacher letters of recommendation, and multiple essays. “I have not, however, ever heard of a student being offered a spot at Stanford based on high SAT scores alone, without submitting a full application.” The Liberal Democrats said Badenoch should reveal the full story behind her apparent offer. A party spokesperson said: “Kemi Badenoch spent months asking questions of the chancellor regarding her CV. It’s now time for her to answer some of her own.” Badenoch has spoken in the past how she felt she was let down by poor British teaching in her final school years, having moved to the UK as the political situation in Nigeria deteriorated. Aged 16, she was studying part-time at Phoenix College, a further education college in Morden, achieving a B in biology, a B in chemistry and a D in maths. She says she had previously been a straight-A student but was repeatedly put down and underestimated by teachers at the college and discouraged from applying for medicine or to the University of Oxford.

politics/2025/aug/03/welsh-20mph-speed-limit-divisive-journey-times-deaths,"Journey times up, deaths down: Welsh 20mph speed limit still divisive two years on","A few weeks ago, two groups of protesters gathered on the steps of the Senedd in Cardiff Bay. One demonstration was against the war in Gaza; the other, against the Welsh government’s two-year-old default 20mph speed limit in urban areas. The change from 30mph was brought in by the Welsh Labour government across about 35% of the country’s roads in September 2023, at a cost of £34m. The reduced speed limit applied to any built-up area, defined as roads where lamp-posts were no more than about 180 metres apart. Last week a small study by GoSafe, which monitors road cameras, found the policy had added an average of two minutes to journey times of differing lengths, aggravating an already bitter culture war over legislation designed to save lives. Collisions along roads that have changed from 30mph to 20mph decreased by 19% in 2024 compared with 2023, and 100 fewer people a year have been killed or badly hurt in road traffic accidents, according to Welsh government figures. Yet according to canvassing Senedd members and local councillors, the issue remains deeply unpopular with voters as the country’s embattled Labour administration gears up for elections next May. The former first minister Mark Drakeford, who spearheaded the policy, has previously said he was surprised at the level of opposition and anger the new limit provoked. The backlash included protests, defacing and knocking down new speed limit signs, and a petition signed by nearly half a million people opposing the policy – the largest in the Senedd’s history. Phil Jones, a chartered engineer and transport planning expert who chaired the Welsh government taskforce on establishing the 20mph default, said the policy was working “exactly as intended”. “There’s nothing preventing local authorities from putting the limit back up. We reviewed practices in other places, journey times, economic impact; none of this should be a surprise,” he said. “Say all the roads go back up and casualties go up again too. What is an acceptable death toll that justifies getting to work two minutes faster? That’s what people who want to get rid of it need to answer.” More than 130,000 drivers – or 34% of people with licences in Wales – have been caught breaking the lower limit since it was introduced, while the most recent YouGov polling, from a year ago, found seven in 10 people opposed the 20mph default. The Welsh Conservatives have consistently called for the law to be scrapped over what the party says is the confusion and frustration it causes for drivers. Sam Rowlands, the shadow cabinet secretary for transport, said: “It’s a hard balance to strike but as a country we’ve been doing this risk assessment for decades, and we landed on 30mph. It’s a huge waste of taxpayer money.” Ken Skates, who took over as transport cabinet secretary in March 2024, was quickly forced into a partial climbdown, giving councils £5m to reassess local speed limits over what he described as “consistent” concerns. Last month, Wrexham began changing 52 roads back to 30mph. Newport council has named 14 roads where the speed limit will go up again, while in Blaneau Gwent one road has changed back, and in Ceredigion no changes are planned.",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/03/welsh-20mph-speed-limit-divisive-journey-times-deaths,Politics,2025-08-03T16:15:44Z,0
culture/2025/oct/13/nigerian-modernism-tate-modern-exhibition-london-ben-okri,"‘A palette unlike anything in the west’: Ben Okri, Yinka Shonibare and more on how Nigerian art revived Britain’s cultural landscape","Some primal energy was unleashed among Nigerian artists in the years leading up to independence. The century-long reign of colonialism was nearing its end and the people of Nigeria, with its over 300 tribes, its ebullient energy, were poised for a new future in which they would determine the shape and context of their lives. And the people who most articulated that double position, that paradox of modernity and tradition, were artists in all their stripes. Artists across the country, in constant dialogue with one another, created works that evoked their traditions but in a contemporary context. Artists such as Yusuf Grillo in the north, Bruce Onobrakpeya from the midwest, Ben Enwonwu from the east and Twins Seven Seven from the west were remaking the dream of art in a rigorously Nigerian context. The effect of the works created by the Zaria Art Society, the generation that congregated in Lagos and exhibited all over the world, was profound. Their work helped the nation to reconnect with its ancient ways, but adapted to modern times. It was a new art, brooding and celebratory. Often it was an art that hinted at the many dimensions of Nigerian mythology; often it drew upon daily realities. Spirits, ancestral presences, rituals, masquerades featured prominently, alongside popular subjects of dancing figures, portraits and landscapes, but rendered in a unique light, with a palette that was utterly unlike anything in the western tradition. It is important to stress that these were not artists creating in isolation. They were in touch with the currents of world art, as can be seen by the responses to cubism in many works of sculpture. It was not a response as such but a taking back, a retrieval, of what cubism took from Africa. The other area in which this Nigerian modernism revealed itself is in the Nigerian novel. Works such as Chinua Achebe’s seminal Things Fall Apart, Wole Soyinka’s The Interpreters and Amos Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard are all works that depict a nation fermenting with energy and cultural tensions. Christopher Okigbo wrote in Labyrinths, 1967, that “We carry in our worlds that flourish / Our worlds that have failed.” But the opposite is also true. We carry in our worlds that have failed, our worlds that flourish. Two important contemporary events bear this out. The much-awaited opening of the art museum in the ancient city of Benin, MOWAA (Museum of West African Art), may be the single most important event in African art since the infamous burning of African works of art by the British in that same city, in 1897. The other is the Tate Modern in London’s upcoming exhibition, Nigerian Modernism, which aims to spotlight Nigeria’s contribution to the wider story of modern art and British culture. Nigerian writers and artists in Britain have been a vital part of that story, not least Ben Enwonwu, who sojourned here during the Nigerian civil war and sculpted Queen Elizabeth II in the 50s. For almost 100 years, figures such as Uzo Egonu, Demas Nwoko and Bruce Onobrakpeya have shaped the visual and intellectual life of these isles. The tradition continues with artists such as El Anatsui, who has expanded the possibilities of global sculpture with his monumental works, and ceramicist Ladi Kwali, who alchemised Nigerian craft and modern design. They have extended the story of Nigerian modernism into contemporary times, bringing about a renewal not only in the art and literature of Africa but of Britain also. Ben Okri Artist Yinka Shonibare on Sade Adu For me, Sade Adu is a perfect example of the British-Nigerian creative spirit. She fused jazz, soul and pop into something that was entirely her own, not copying anyone, but creating a new sound. That is what Nigerian modernism does too: it makes something new out of history. I grew up between Lagos and London, and used to pay frequent visits to Lagos’s National Museum, which is where I first saw Ben Enwonwu’s sculpture Anyanwu. It was powerful, uplifting and deeply connected to Nigerian identity, and left a lasting impression on me, even as a child. In 1977, when I was a teenager, Nigeria hosted the landmark Festival of Black Arts and Culture, and the National Theatre in Lagos was full of newly commissioned work: stained glass, carvings, monumental installations. It was a formative experience, showing me that art could tell the story of a nation. Nigerian modernism is, in many ways, about identity – about how to live with the legacy of colonialism and create something that feels both contemporary and connected to the past. That question has shaped my own work, too. Being British-Nigerian means you are constantly navigating both worlds, which is ripe for creative opportunity. This is why the Tate exhibition is so important. For too long, African art has been viewed through the lens of European artists who were influenced by it, such as Picasso. This exhibition centres Nigerian artists on their own terms. I think part of the reason that British-Nigerians are so overrepresented in the creative industries is because, for many of us, success was the only option. Your parents certainly didn’t bring you to the UK to fail, so there is that cultural drive and discipline which breeds ambition. Labour MP Chi Onwurah on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie If I had to choose one piece of Nigerian art which has affected me the most, it would be Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It is about the Nigerian civil war in the 60s, which separated my family. My parents never spoke about it, so reading that book in 2006 was a seminal moment for me – it gave voice to a history that had shaped my life but was never spoken about. I grew up in Newcastle in the 70s and 80s, and there was no exposure to Nigerian or British-Nigerian art or artists. My school friends would make fun of the idea of Nigerian or African art. We sought out representation wherever we could. There’s a dynamism in Nigerian culture that I think was suppressed for decades by a lack of opportunity and acceptance in the UK. It was only when I lived in Lagos in the early 2000s that I saw the incredible range of Nigerian artists. Their work was so alive, and it also revealed the blandness of European artists like Picasso’s take on African visual expressionism. Some of my favourite artists are featured in the Tate’s exhibition, including Yinka Shonibare. I remember seeing his early works in London Underground stations more than 20 years ago – his depictions of historical European figures wearing west African cloth were extraordinary. They brought together two worlds that seemed separate but were deeply connected through colonialism and slavery. Bruce Onobrakpeya’s use of materials like circuit boards also resonates with me as a trained engineer, too. Historian Alayo Akinkugbe on Fela Kuti I loved discovering Fela Kuti as a teenager – the way he performed shirtless, in vibrant costumes, and spoke truth to power. I’d grown up with the idea that we always had to be very cautious of not wanting to say too much when it came to politics. His music – a fusion of jazz, funk and Yoruba rhythms – became a soundtrack and a rallying cry for resistance, and he taught me that Nigerians can be unapologetically outspoken and creative, something that feels even more urgent for my generation. With the huge #EndSars movement which took place in Nigeria in 2020, protesting against police brutality, there has been a new wave of political activism among young people, and it’s useful to have the blueprint of someone like Fela. Similarly, Ben Enwonwu’s work was everywhere when I was growing up – his Africa Dances series, with its elegant, dancing figures, perfectly captured the post-independence mood. My grandfather was a friend of his, so we had his paintings at home. Yusuf Grillo was another formative influence – his monumental crowd and market scenes have stayed with me since childhood and shaped the way I think about colour and scale. A turning point in the recognition of Nigerian modernism came in 2018, when Enwonwu’s portrait Tutu sold at Bonhams for £1.2m. Suddenly, Nigerian art was being taken seriously by the global art market. Questions of ownership inevitably come up in the British-Nigerian context. The Benin bronzes are the most famous example, but there are thousands of looted works in European collections. The Tate exhibition will inevitably reopen these questions, as will the landmark opening of MOWAA in Benin. There will be a major cultural institution in Nigeria ready to house repatriated works, which forces us to ask: who should these objects belong to? Artist Joy Labinjo on Njideka Akunyili Crosby The artist who has inspired me most is Njideka Akunyili Crosby. I saw her work for the first time at the Venice Biennale in 2013, and it felt like coming home. Her focus on family, domestic life and memory gave me the confidence to know that my own experiences were enough, and that I could build a career making work that is unapologetically personal. I make figurative paintings that explore identity, memory and family, often drawing on my own Nigerian-British heritage. My practice began with looking backwards – at family photographs, Nigerian parties, rich fabrics – and translating those memories into paint. Studying British painting techniques and historic composition gave me the tools to fuse these experiences with my British identity, and that fusion became the language I use as an artist today. It wasn’t until my mid-20s that I began discovering Black artists – specifically Nigerian ones – because art education largely ignored them. In the last five years or so, Nigeria’s cultural presence has grown significantly. Afrobeats went global around a decade ago, and the visual arts followed, with young diaspora artists finding their voices. Nigerians are, fundamentally, hustlers. I think that is why the diaspora is so prolific in the creative space: a natural drive, a strong work ethic and a community that supports one another. Being in the UK has given more access, but our ambition is rooted in culture. Poet Inua Ellams on Wole Soyinka Yinka Shonibare is an artist who continually inspires me, as do Caleb Femi’s interdisciplinary practices, which have been formative. In terms of music, Sunny Ade and Fela Kuti transport me across time and space. Contemporary artists such as Victor Ehikhamenor inspire me – his abstract, symbol-charged work feels like African morse code. I still search for meaning in it, even when it feels incomprehensible, and that search is satisfying. I also have to mention Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman, which demonstrates the power of storytelling to address post-colonial politics. The play is now a staple for the Black and west African literati, but it was so far ahead of its time in the themes it discussed. Soyinka was the first African writer to win the Nobel prize for literature in 1986, and he is still probably the most influential Nigerian writer alive today. From an early age my creativity was shaped by the clothes my parents wore – tailored fabrics, bold colours and patterns that fused Nigerian and Muslim aesthetics. I remember wearing my mother’s blue wrapper over a T-shirt emblazoned with my name and running around calling myself “Nigerian Superman”. Those early experiments in cloth, colour and storytelling formed the foundation of my artistic sensibility. Moving to the UK, my sense of identity became inseparable from the immigrant experience. Living under Theresa May’s hostile environment policy and anti-immigrant rhetoric made it impossible to claim full Britishness. I clung to Nigerian culture while negotiating a space within Britain’s creative landscape. Nigeria is a particular hotbed of pressure and hustle mentality, which forces creativity. There is also so much creative exchange within the diaspora, and that collaboration fills the creative coffers creators draw from. Rising incomes for second-generation Nigerians have also meant that their parents stopped insisting they become doctors or lawyers and began encouraging creative endeavours. Novelist Diana Evans on Mary Evans If there was one artist who has inspired me the most, it would be my sister, Mary Evans. She is a fine artist, explores colonial history and the transatlantic slave trade in her paper works. Her piece Hold, with its tiny, intricate figures, is subtle, poignant and political, and it hangs on a wall in my house. It’s a representation of the hold of a slave ship, and is incredibly evocative but in a very quiet way. She has always been a huge inspiration to me, and it still feels like a huge privilege to have her work in my home. I see a parallel in Nigerian modernism and the way I approach my work as a novelist. The modernists’ ability to fuse African traditions with western techniques mirrors my own approach to narrative: blending British literary forms with Nigerian diasporic experience. I first encountered Nigerian literature seriously in my early-20s through Ben Okri. His dreamlike, bold storytelling opened a world of possibility – just the complexity, the richness, the boldness of it. He showed me these fantastic landscapes and worlds you could take the reader into, just through the power of sentences. Visual art also continues to inform me. Chris Ofili’s No Woman, No Cry, dedicated to Stephen Lawrence, is a work I return to again and again. Music is another constant influence. Nigerian artists such as Wizkid, and British-Nigerian musicians such as Tinie Tempah and Dave, bring an energy and confidence that I try to bring to my writing. Ezra Collective trumpeter-composer Ife Ogunjobi on Skepta A song which has particularly influenced me is Energy (Stay Far Away) by Skepta and Wizkid. Beyond the music itself, it represents collaboration and unity between London and Nigeria – Skepta is always outspoken about his Nigerian heritage, and makes a big deal about going back to visit. The music video too, which is filmed partly in Nigeria, highlights the dialogue between our two worlds. Nigerians are very proud, outspoken, loud people. If a Nigerian has something to say, best believe you’re going to hear it, whether you like it or not. And I think that has a lot to do with why there are so many of us across the creative sphere. Particularly in London, there’s a huge Nigerian influence – everything from restaurants to fashion to music. We all have something to say, and we’re impossible to escape. And rightfully so, because our culture is so beautiful and diverse. My music is a fusion of the sounds I grew up with: Nigerian highlife, Fuji, Afrobeats. Artists such as Ebenezer Obey and King Sunny Adé, alongside modern influences such as Wizkid and Burna Boy, and British sounds such as grime and UK rap. I also see Nigerian influence a lot more in fashion and visual art – I love Yinka Ilori’s work, for example. Poet Theresa Lola on Niyi Osundare For me, poetry has been the primary bridge connecting me to Nigeria, especially as someone who doesn’t speak Yoruba. Niyi Osundare’s poetry has been formative in showing how Nigerian writers can speak to universal themes while remaining deeply rooted in their culture. Similarly, the work of Prof Molara Ogundipe and Gabriel Okara demonstrates how experimentation within tradition can generate new forms of expression. In my work, I draw heavily on Yoruba literary forms, particularly the Oriki, a traditional praise poetry form, and Yoruba proverbs. Oriki are names, phrases or poetic expressions passed down through generations, often used to honour lineage, celebrate achievements or preserve memory. These forms provide a rhythm, structure and depth that English alone cannot capture, and they have become a language for me, a way to inhabit Nigerian heritage even without speaking the language fluently. The duality of my heritage informs what I find most urgent in my work, navigating the multiple aspects of my identity. I am Nigerian, I am Black, I am British, I am a woman. These intersecting experiences bring different urgencies and curiosities into my poetry, which becomes a space where these influences and perspectives melt together.

culture/2025/oct/06/louis-ck-defends-riyadh-comedy-festival-performance-good-opportunity,Louis CK defends decision to perform at Riyadh comedy festival as ‘a good opportunity’,"Louis CK has defended his decision to perform at the Riyadh comedy festival in Saudi Arabia after fellow comedians criticised the big names taking part as whitewashing a regime guilty of human rights abuses. Speaking on Real Time With Bill Maher, CK, who is co-headlining the festival with the British comedian Jimmy Carr on Monday night local time, said other comedians had been “really surprised” by the response from audiences in Riyadh so far. Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Aziz Ansari, Hannibal Burress, Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, Tom Segura and Jeff Ross are among the lineup at Riyadh comedy festival, which finishes on 9 October. “There’s a woman who’s a lesbian and Jewish, who did a show there, and she got a standing ovation,” CK said, referring to Jessica Kirson, who has expressed “sincere regret” for performing at the festival. “So, there’s stuff going on that’s unexpected in this thing,” CK continued. “People have been playing Saudi Arabia for years. Comedians have been going and playing Arab countries. There was a film festival there recently, it’s kind of opened up. But I’ve always said no to Arab countries.” CK said he was told there would only be two restrictions on what he could talk about on stage: “Their religion and their government.” “I don’t have jokes about those two things,” he added. “It used to be when I got offers from places like that, there would be a long list, and I’d just say, ‘No, I don’t need that.’ But when I heard it’s opening, I thought, that’s awfully interesting. That just feels like a good opportunity. And I just feel like comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.” Several comedians have questioned the ethics of performing comedy at a festival directly paid for by the Saudi Arabian government, which is notorious for human rights abuses and censorship, and its oppression of journalists, women and LGBTQ rights. The festival’s producers include Sela, a live events company owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund; and the kingdom’s General Entertainment Authority, which is chaired by Turki al-Sheikh, a royal adviser dogged by allegations of human rights violations, including the detention of people who criticise him on social media. Human Rights Watch argued the festival was an effort by the Saudi government to whitewash its actions “amid significant increase in repression including a crackdown on free speech, which many of these comedians defend but people in Saudi Arabia are completely denied”. Comedians including Marc Maron, Atsuko Okatsuka and David Cross have been scathing of performers who have complained about cancel culture and censorship in the past for agreeing to take part in Riyadh, with Cross publishing a blistering statement on his website that called out CK by name. “Clearly you guys don’t give a shit about what the rest of us think, but how can any of us take any of you seriously ever again?” Cross wrote. “All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and all that shit? Done. You don’t get to talk about it ever again. By now we’ve all seen the contract you had to sign.” CK acknowledged the criticism on Maher’s show. “I had mixed feelings about it too,” he said. “I struggled about going once I heard what everybody was saying. There’s some good in it, maybe some bad in it. But for me, I think it cuts toward going. That’s my decision, and I know where it’s coming from, because I can see right inside myself.” He added: “I love standup comedy, and I love comedians. So, the fact that that’s opening up and starting to bud, I wanna see it, I wanna be part of it. I think that’s a positive thing.” Kirson, who performed at the Riyadh festival on 29 September, told the Hollywood Reporter on Friday that she had asked for a guarantee that she could talk about being a lesbian on stage, saying she “hoped that this could help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued … to my knowledge, I am the first openly gay comic to talk about it on stage in Saudi Arabia”. But she added: “At the same time, I deeply regret participating under the auspices of the Saudi government.” She apologised to fans who were disappointed by “a poor decision that had repercussions I didn’t fully consider” and said she would donate her fee to a human rights organisation. Burr, who performed in Riyadh on 26 September, defended his choice to take part, calling it “a mind-blowing experience”. “It was great to experience that part of the world and to be a part of the first comedy festival over there in Saudi Arabia,” Burr said on an episode of his Monday Morning Podcast. “The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled. The comedians that I’ve been talking to are saying, ‘Dude, you can feel [the audience] wanted it. They want to see real standup comedy’ … I think it’s going to lead to a lot of positive things.”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/06/louis-ck-defends-riyadh-comedy-festival-performance-good-opportunity,Culture,2025-10-06T01:09:01Z,14
artanddesign/2025/oct/08/drag-queen-site-of-violence-lee-ann-olwages-best-photograph-africa,A drag queen stands at a site of violence: Lee-Ann Olwage’s best photograph,"I have always been interested in gender and identity stories. In South Africa, we have a strong liberal constitution on paper for queer rights, but the reality on the streets – the hate crimes, the animosity in the workplace and in social settings – is very different. I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. That led me to the drag pageant scene. I would go to photograph pageants every weekend, and every Monday I would get messages from the people I’d photographed asking me to send the pictures – so I had a lot of instant feedback on the work I was making. I was using harsh lighting to play with the idea of masculine and feminine, to emphasise the contrast between the strong jawlines and the feminine personae. But there’s no one more honest than a drag queen, and very early on, someone told me they really didn’t like the picture I’d taken of them. It was hard to hear, but letting go of my ego I asked this person why. They said it was because they didn’t look beautiful. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. I changed my approach. And if I hadn’t had that knock to my ego, the work wouldn’t have become what it needed to be. Over the next year and a half, making the work became a conversation with the drag queens. I put it out there that I wanted to do a collaborative project. Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. The idea was to work with other drag artists and visit places where acts of violence had happened, and to reclaim these places. I told Belinda to think about who should tell this story – I wanted her to consider carefully if I was the right person. Two weeks later, she came back and said she wanted to work with me. I was concerned for the drag queens’ safety, not only while going to these sites of violence and making the images but also after, as some of them lived in the townships where the portraits would be made. I sat with it for a while. But one thing Belinda said stuck with me. She said: “If we don’t go, if we don’t reclaim these spaces and make these pictures, then it’s like we don’t exist.” The entire series was shot in four hours. We met at a petrol station on the day, so the drag queens could get ready – everyone had specific ideas about what they wanted to wear. We moved quickly and didn’t linger. I was definitely nervous – it made me realise how these people feel every day, you can never fully relax. I photographed Belinda at the shisanyama – a community space where women cook and sell meat – in Khayelitsha, a township located on the Cape Flats, near Cape Town. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was the end of the day and the light was really good – everything came together, with the lady in the background staring. If you look carefully, you can see my shadow – I love that I’m a part of it, that always makes me smile. Belinda has such a regal, enigmatic presence. There’s something about her – I hope it comes across in the image. Afterwards we organised a show at a community hall in Khayelitsha. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It’s amazing to have global exposure for the issues we care about, but none of that is as valuable as showing the work in the space it was created. Lee-Ann Olwage’s CV Born: Durban, 1986 Trained: “I’m a self-trained photographer but studied film directing at AFDA film school in Cape Town.” Influences: “My peers, life, the stories I work on, and other forms of storytelling: painting, music, weaving, textile art.” High point: “Winning the World Press Photo award in 2020. It wasn’t so much the award but the fact that people celebrated a story I loved and my way of seeing the world. It gave me a new confidence that helped me take the next steps in my career.” Low point: “Working with a journalist who was not respectful of the community we were in. I still resent myself for not speaking up about the situation sooner.” Top tip: “Surround yourself with people doing what they love.” • This image is part of the World Press Photo print sale, 17-26 November, in celebration of World Press Photo at 70",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/08/drag-queen-site-of-violence-lee-ann-olwages-best-photograph-africa,Art and design,2025-10-08T14:08:02Z,12
culture/2025/oct/03/wrestling-clash-comics-max-olesker-ivan-gonzalez-fist-club-still-lives,Get ready to rumble: how wrestling broke out of the ring and on to the stage,"Phil Wang was about to get his hands on the championship belt. He was claiming the prize for Clash of the Comics, the bombastic night that throws comedians and pro wrestlers into the ring, when Ed Gamble stormed in, knocked everyone out, and swanned off with the belt. “Well,” corrects the comedian and Clash co-founder Max Olesker, “we were knocked down by his henchman.” Hulking pro wrestler Bullit was the one to clothesline him and his comedy partner, Ivan Gonzalez. “I think I could have taken Ed if he’d been on his own,” huffs Olesker. The popularity of pro wrestling has fluctuated since its golden era in the 1980s. At the start of this year, WWE made the leap on to Netflix with an eye-watering $5bn (£4bn) deal, inching the skimpily clad, heavily muscled combat sport higher in the public consciousness. In Britain, it has a rich working-class history, growing from the grassroots to raising some of the greatest international contenders such as Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr. Now, wrestling is dipping a greased-up toe into the theatrical limelight, with a smattering of productions across the UK welcoming new audiences through alternative performance lenses, from comedy to queer cabaret to a living sculpture that uses bondage to suspend disbelief. Olesker, who used to be the UK’s youngest pro wrestler as Max Voltage, was the one to introduce Gonzalez to wrestling, putting on a match in the student union at university. “The atmosphere was electric,” Gonzalez remembers. “It’s this larger-than-life pantomime: good versus evil.” Forming a comedy duo together as Max &amp; Ivan, the pair decided to blend the art forms for a show at the Edinburgh fringe, convincing pro wrestlers that they weren’t making fun of them and persuading comedians to throw themselves off the ropes. The Wrestling, as it was then called, won the Edinburgh comedy award and has rocketed in popularity since. Renamed Clash of the Comics, the brutal showdown that saw Rosie Jones defeat Greg Davies at the O2, as part of the 2023 Just for Laughs festival, is about to take over the Hammersmith Apollo, west London, where for the first time it will stand outside a wider comedy festival. The lineup includes pro wrestlers Simon Miller, Cara Noir and La Cyclonica, with comedians Aisling Bea, Flo &amp; Joan and James Acaster, who has issued an open challenge to any comedian or wrestler willing to take him on. And, naturally, Wang needs to win his championship belt back from Gamble. Commentating from the sidelines, Nish Kumar will be cheering for the rule-breaking baddies, Sara Pascoe will support the good and righteous, and Greg James will give an impartial play-by-play. Comedy is key to the night, but the show’s success relies on the spectacles in the ring. “They’re both performance art,” Olesker considers. “You travel the world, you react to an audience. It’s a real meeting of disciplines.” Logistically, the event is a nightmare. The comedians are sent to wrestling school to make their transformations possible. “I guess in the same way that Strictly Come Dancing teaches the celebrities not to become professional dancers, but to dance a very specific dance,” Gonzalez says, “we teach our comedians to wrestle for one specific moment.” The comics often come with ambitions of spectacular moves, which the team do their best to realise. “And much like Strictly,” Olesker adds, “all our wrestlers and comedians are having affairs with one another.” He keeps a straight face. “It just makes the whole thing fly.” Wrestling walks a constant tightrope between reality and pretence. “You’re training your body to be an athlete,” says Heather Bandenberg, who runs Fist Club, an LGBTQ+ cabaret night pitched as “Wrestling but gayer”. Melding queer performance and pro wrestling, the night features back-flipping drag kings, anarchic performances from pro wrestlers and an openness to the types of bodies that tend to be excluded from the mainstream. “You’re training to be a gymnast and you’re doing elements of stunt,” Bandenberg says. “It hurts.” One of the early moves a wrestler learns is how to “bump”, the classic move where they throw themselves on to the floor in order to imitate the impact of being thrown by someone else. The impact is real, even if the weight distribution and choreography lessen the pain. “There is an element of danger,” says Bandenberg. The liveness exaggerates this, as shows teeter between planned and improvised. “It’s one of the few performance art forms where the reaction of the crowd informs what will happen,” says Olesker. “People won’t do an extra scene in a Shakespeare play if people are really into it.” Bandenberg stumbled upon wrestling by accident, quickly falling for the space it allowed her to take up. “WWE has never been a great place to be a woman,” she says. “I saw the main world of wrestling and was like: This isn’t for me. But I found I wasn’t the only person who felt like this.” She formed the event with pro wrestling drag kings Rich Tea and Rocky Rhodes. For them, the collaboration between wrestling and cabaret seemed obvious. “Wrestling is drag,” Bandenberg says. “You have an alter ego. You’re getting the audience on your side.” Run for queer and female wrestlers, Fist Club leaps between venues across the UK and sells out fast, with some audience members having been persuaded to start wrestling themselves. Primarily featuring smack-talking drag kings, the night has a quota of 10% of straight male wrestlers: “Because that’s what it’s like to be a woman or queer person on a normal wrestling show.” The audience of their last show included a vicar in her 60s, who apparently had a glorious time. “We want it to be open to people who have never seen wrestling before,” Bandenberg says. A successful match relies on the sell: the performance. “You’re trying to make the audience believe you’re actually getting, you know, completely totalled in the face,” Bandenberg explains while miming knocking herself out. All the hosts are careful to make everything as safe as possible for their shows, but injuries aren’t uncommon. Olesker broke his ankle in the first show. In training, Bandenburg jumped off the top rope and broke both her big toes. “But I’ve got off lightly,” she shrugs. In Glasgow, the speed of a typical wrestling match is being frozen in time for a new piece of performance art. Luke George and Daniel Kok are the artists behind Still Lives, an installation using shibari, a rope-knotting bondage technique typically used in kink practice, to construct still images in the air. Adapting the piece to every city it moves to, they wrap people up, heave them high and suspend them, creating these breathing images with Australian rules players in Melbourne and rugby union players in Auckland. They are particularly interested in using underrepresented bodies. It’s not always sport; in Venice they wrapped up a gondolier. “We’re looking for something that can give us a sense of what life is like in that city,” says Kok. In Glasgow, they have chosen wrestling, using the bodies of pro wrestlers Molly Spartan and Jake Lawless to create the living sculpture. Audiences will watch as the pair are carefully tied and hauled up, then slowly brought back down and undone. Coming from dance and performance backgrounds, the artists are invested in endurance and what the body is capable of. “We’re working with degrees of discomfort and endurance,” George says of the physical demands on the participants, “but it’s not sitting in pain for an hour.” Bondage drags with it certain assumptions about violence and dominance, yet both shibari and wrestling delicately navigate care, consent and power. “It’s about trust and communication, about listening to each other and watching for cues,” George says. They’ve been surprised by the similarities between the art forms, with each relying on watchful adjustments throughout. “Wrestlers have ways to communicate when there’s a certain narrative arc they’re trying to achieve,” Kok says, “so they’re looking out for each other even while they’re fighting.” Wider popularity for wrestling may come in waves, but for the truly dedicated, commitment is unrelenting. Months are spent organising getting the Clash of the Comics comedians to wrestling school. The Fist Club fighters train multiple times a week, with Still Lives capturing this devotion by stretching out the patient endurance of preparation. Through their chosen styles, these artists want to celebrate the sport, welcome new supporters and show that wrestling doesn’t belong to a single gender, shape or style. “There’s so much happening live,” says Bandenberg, “done by people who love it. They’re not getting rich off it, they’re just seeing it as a creative art form that brings joy.” Clash of the Comics is at Hammersmith Apollo, London, 8 October; Fist Club is at Colour Factory, London, 11 October, and Lost Horizon, Bristol, 8 November; Still Lives is part of Take Me Somewhere, Tramway, Glasgow, 25 October.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/03/wrestling-clash-comics-max-olesker-ivan-gonzalez-fist-club-still-lives,Culture,2025-10-03T12:00:35Z,12

culture/2025/oct/08/bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival,Bill Burr calls critics of Riyadh comedy festival ‘sanctimonious’ and ‘phoney’,"Bill Burr has defended his appearance at the controversial Riyadh comedy festival, calling his critics “sanctimonious cunts”. The comedian has been under fire, alongside Kevin Hart, Louis CK, Aziz Ansari and Dave Chappelle, for being on the lineup for what was billed as “the world’s largest comedy festival”. The Human Rights Watch called out the event as a distraction, aiming to focus on something light rather than the “soaring number of executions” taking place while comedians such as Marc Maron and Shane Gillis expressed disappointment. David Cross wrote that he was “disgusted” in a statement. Burr spoke to Conan O’Brien as part of a live podcast, and said he felt “wonderful” about his appearance and doesn’t “give a fuck what all these phoney fucking people are saying”. “It was necessary,” he said. “It felt right afterward. I vibed with them and they were funny. Fuck, they were funny fucking people. I don’t know what to tell you. I had a good time.” He claimed he was one of the comedians who had “the most amount of shit” for appearing. “All of these sanctimonious cunts out there … who don’t really sincerely give a shit,” he said. “If you actually give a fuck about those people and how they’re living over there, there’s gonna have to be these types of things to pull them in. And I will tell you, the Cheesecake Factory in Riyadh, it’s incredible. It’s right next to Pizza Hut and KFC, and if you want a pair of Timberlands, it’s across the street next to the Marriott, catty-corner to the fucking Hilton.” Burr also said that the US was “moving towards” Saudi Arabia with Ice “fucking grabbing moms and dads and sticking them in a van for making illegally made fucking tacos” which he called “fucking insane”. Since appearing, the lesbian comic Jessica Kirson has expressed “sincere regret” but said she was there to “help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued”. Those in the community have zero legal protections in the country and could face execution. Burr called out the “hardcore psycho gays” for the backlash she faced. This week also saw Ansari, who is currently promoting his directorial debut Good Fortune, asked about the event by Jimmy Kimmel. “It’s something I put a lot of thought into,” he said. “I have an aunt that lived there for a while and I talked to her about this and she said there’s people over there that don’t agree with the stuff that the government’s doing and to ascribe the worst behaviour of the government on to those people is not fair just like there’s people in America who don’t agree with the things the government is doing.” He added that he thought the festival would help to push “things to be more open and to push a dialogue”. But he “shares the concerns” and has said that part of his fee is going towards organisations that support free press and human rights in the region. Louis CK also addressed the backlash, calling the festival “a good opportunity” and saying “comedy is a great way to get in and start talking”. Members of the Human Rights Watch had tried to meet with the comedians on the lineup before the event but had no response. “The seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder is no laughing matter, and comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn’t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher. “Everyone performing in Riyadh should use this high-profile opportunity to call for the release of detained Saudi activists.” In August, the Human Rights Watch stated that Saudi authorities had executed at least 241 people in 2025 and if this number continued at the same rate, it would exceed all prior yearly records.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/08/bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival,Culture,2025-10-08T14:32:53Z,7
artanddesign/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-architecture-critic-dictator-bling,‘Dictator-for-life vibes’: our architecture critic on Trump’s bulletproof ballroom bling,"As if truffling thuggishly in pursuit of the Nobel peace prize wasn’t enough, the spectacle of bulldozers ripping into the White House is yet more evidence of Donald Trump’s unstinting quest for epic self-aggrandisement. Having decreed the East Wing not fit for purpose – namely, his purposes of swank and show – he plans to replace it with a faux classical bulletproof ballroom, capable of seating up to 650 partygoers. Renderings show a vast, glacially white aircraft hangar of a structure embellished with an ornate coffered ceiling, gilded Corinthian columns and drooping gold chandeliers. Nero, who conceived the original domus aurea, would feel right at home. Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will. On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden. So, having been here before, the American Institute of Architects is wearily wary, stating: “AIA is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities, mandate official federal design preferences, or otherwise hinder design freedom, and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings.” White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing, Richard Nixon installed a bowling lane and Harry S Truman commissioned an entire reconstruction. Several first ladies have revamped the decor and furnishings, notably Jackie Kennedy, whose soigné interiors were designed to connect the presidential home more resonantly with American history. The now doomed East Wing, dating from 1902, has been a much-changed addition. Intermittently housing the office of the first lady, what’s left of it sits above the presidential emergency operations centre, a high security bunker built during the second world war. Vice-president Dick Cheney and his retinue retreated there during the 9/11 attacks, as did Trump at the start of the George Floyd protests in 2020. The man who landed the ballroom job is James McCrery, founder of Washington-based McCrery Architects and a trenchant advocate of classical architecture. “Americans love classical architecture,” he has said, “because it is our formative architecture – and we love our nation’s formation.” Ironically, McCrery began his career working for Peter Eisenman, the high priest of deconstructivism, before a conversion of Damascene proportions prompted him to renounce the avant garde and “rethink his modernist education”. Specialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC. Trump’s style edicts and building bombast exude a dictator-for-life megalomania vibe, as he barrels through his second term, with an unconstitutional third potentially in his sights. However, he is said to dislike the White House, finding it on the poky side, preferring to decamp to his Floridian resort Mar-a-Lago at every opportunity. The tone for his latest stay in the White House was set by his patio-fication of the Rose Garden, but he is now clearly aiming for a legacy more substantial than a bit of paving. His record as a “patron” of architecture has been shaped by his rollercoaster career as a property developer. To him, buildings are simply extruded capital. He has an enduring fondness for Louis XIV bling, epitomised by his enrobing of a 1960s Manhattan skyscraper in golden bronze cladding to transform it into the gleamingly phallic Trump International Hotel and Tower. His more recent engoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared to a professional wrestler’s dressing room. Nonetheless, Trump’s experience as a developer was formative, in that it taught him he could get away with just about anything. It crystallised a poisonous bravado, now hardwired into the national political sphere. His fetishisation of classicism, a historically recurring comfort blanket for despots of all stripes, is bleakly predictable. “It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.” Another imperial wheeze, announced at a reception for prospective ballroom donors, is a huge triumphal arch, to be erected just across the Potomac river from the Lincoln Memorial. Modelled on the Parisian original and topped with a gilded, winged goddess of victory, the “Arc de Trump” is intended to commemorate the US’s 250th anniversary next year. In launching this newest vanity project, Trump said: “We love to fix up Washington.” Again, Nero would doubtless approve.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-architecture-critic-dictator-bling,Art and design,2025-10-23T15:00:44Z,6
culture/2025/oct/22/stephen-colbert-trump-white-house-demolition,Stephen Colbert on Trump’s White House East Wing demolition: ‘So deeply unsettling’,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s partial demolition of the East Wing of the White House for his proposed $250m gilded ballroom. Stephen Colbert “At this point, we’re nine months into this, you’d think it would be impossible for us to be shocked by Donald Trump,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “But give the man credit – every so often, he takes the time to attach the electrodes to our nipples. And then it feels like the first time.” Case in point: on Monday, as part of his White House renovation project to construct a gilded ballroom, Trump sent out a backhoe to rip off a part of the East Wing. “That is it, we are not giving him the security deposit back,” Colbert quipped. “That is so deeply unsettling,” he continued. “It’s like being a kid and seeing your teacher at the grocery store … for sale … in the meat department. “We’re just nine months into Trump’s term, and he’s already going ‘Hulk smash’ on the White House. Last time, it took at least four years to bring a demo crew to the Capitol,” he added, referring to January 6. The demolition comes after Trump promised that the $250m, 90,000-sq-ft ballroom renovation would not touch the existing White House. “So that was a lie,” said Colbert. “At this point, should we even believe that this is going to end up being a ballroom? It could just as easily end up being a combination Pizza Hut-Taco Bell!” The treasury department has even instructed its employees not to share any photos of the White House “construction”. “Not generally something you instruct when you’re proud of what’s going on,” Colbert noted. “Hey guys, remember, no photos at my wedding … and it’s not because I’m marrying a body pillow of Mariah Carey.’” The Daily Show “The government shutdown is now in its third week,” said Michael Kosta on the Daily Show. “Countless federal employees aren’t being paid. Food stamps will run out soon. And there’s no end in sight. But not to worry – President Trump is working day and night … to build a ballroom! “It’s exactly what you voted for, coalminers in Pennsylvania: 90,000 gilded sq ft for Trump to do the jerk-off dance in,” he joked. “But if you’re worried such a renovation might damage the people’s house, let Donald Trump put your fears to rest.” Trump claimed that the project would “not interfere with the current building” because it would be “near it but not touching it” and “paying total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of, it’s my favorite” “Yeah, it’s my favorite. I never want to leave … and I’m never going to,” Kosta mocked. “I believe it’s his favorite building, though. He loves the history, the decor, the immunity from criminal convictions it provides. But great! The White House itself is going to be fine.” Until a backhoe tore down some of the East Wing facade. “Well, it looks like they touched it,” Kosta joked. “I mean, holy shit, who’s his general contractor? Bin Laden and Sons?” “Apparently ‘not touching’ the White House turned into ‘demolishing’ the White House,” he added. “And for what? Does he really need a ballroom attached to his home? I mean, I guess it would be good to have one room where Barron did not have to crouch, but still.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also responded to the East Wing demolition. “You guys, I don’t think he’s planning on leaving in three years,” he said. “If I had three years left on a lease, I wouldn’t even put up a shelf.” In other news, during a White House press conference on Monday, Trump claimed that a cameraman hit a mirror with a piece of equipment. “Luckily, no one in his administration casts a reflection,” Meyers joked next to a photo of ghoulish adviser Stephen Miller. After Trump praised the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, during a press conference on Monday, Albanese said that he would use clips of those compliments in 2028 campaign ads. “So will I, said his opponent,” Meyers quipped. And more than a dozen airports across the country have refused to play a partisan video of the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, at TSA checkpoints. “It just really riles up the dogs,” Meyers said, referring to Noem’s admission in her own memoir that she shot her own puppy for its behavior.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/22/stephen-colbert-trump-white-house-demolition,Culture,2025-10-22T15:17:57Z,6
culture/2025/oct/24/seth-meyers-trump-ballroom-white-house,Seth Meyers on Trump’s White House ballroom: ‘This couldn’t be any more of a bait and switch’,"Late-night hosts mocked Donald Trump’s demolition of the East Wing of the White House and the corporate sponsors of his $300m gilded ballroom. Seth Meyers On Thursday’s Late Night, Seth Meyers expressed disbelief over the president’s gilded ballroom project for the White House. “It would be bad enough if Trump’s biggest priority was just building a gilded vanity project for himself, but it’s so much worse,” he said. “Because to do it, he’s tearing down a somewhat well-known and beloved piece of property.” That would be the entire East Wing of the presidential residence, which has stood for 120 years. “He’s tearing down the entire East Wing to build his stupid ballroom. I mean, look at this,” Meyers marveled. “This is like a sequel to Fixer Upper called Fucked Upper. “And of course, Trump also lied about this project.” When he first announced it, he promised no demolition and said it “won’t interfere with the current building” because it would be “near it but not touching it”. “So he basically promised to treat it like his marriage,” Meyers quipped. Trump said plans had changed “after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world”. “Oh yeah? Who was the architect you talked to, Godzilla?” Meyers joked. Outrage has been swift, if ineffective. The National Trust for Historic Preservation sent a letter to Trump saying that the addition would overwhelm the structure and asked him to pause construction until the plans could be reviewed. “One, I couldn’t agree more with the National Trust for Historic Preservation,” said Meyers. “And two, good luck with your letter. “This couldn’t be any more of a bait and switch,” he added. “Trump got elected by claiming he was going to make life more affordable for hardworking Americans, and now he’s demolishing the White House to build himself a gilded vanity project.” Stephen Colbert “As of this morning, the East Wing looked like a rotisserie chicken your dog got into,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. “That is very upsetting to look at, I realize that, and you know the administration knows that,” because on Thursday, the Secret Service closed access to the Ellipse park, a public area where journalists had been capturing images of the demolition. “Well that makes sense – if none of it is on camera, they can just claim the East Wing hanged itself in prison,” Colbert quipped. The host pointed out that it was “a lot of history being smashed to rubble”, as the East Wing was built in 1902 and had been the headquarters for presidential spouses since the Carter administration. “In fact, Melania was in the East Wing, and I certainly hope they got her out of there because she’s often mistaken for a beautiful floor lamp,” Colbert joked over a photo in one of the first lady’s more non-traditional outfits. Trump has funded the “ball-doggle” with money from “groveling corporations” including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Google, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Meta Platforms and Hard Rock International. “And Trump needs all the cash he can get,” said Colbert, as the estimated cost has already risen from an initial $250m to over $300m, for a 90,000 sq-ft (8,400 sq-meter) construction, larger than the existing White House itself. “That’s about the same size as a professional soccer field,” Colbert noted. “So remember, corporations, as you bribe the president: no hands.” The Daily Show And on the Daily Show, Michael Kosta tracked the swift evolution of the project from proposal to execution. “When he started, he promised that it would be separate from the existing White House and he wouldn’t touch the East Wing. That this construction would strictly be over the pants,” he recapped. “Then this week, there was a minor change to the plan when Trump ripped open the side of the East Wing like it had a Labubu inside.” By Thursday, the entire East Wing was gone. “This is all happening so fast,” he said. “This guy’s been taking 15 years to give us a healthcare plan, but in 3.5 days he’s demolished half the White House. Donny T, tell me this is going to end up looking good …” Not quite – according to Trump’s own scale model, which he presented in the Oval Office, the ballroom will dwarf the current White House. “It looks like one of those crabs with the big arms, doesn’t it?” Kosta laughed. “I mean, I don’t know a lot about architecture. But I do know a thing or two about overcompensating for a small penis.”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/24/seth-meyers-trump-ballroom-white-house,Culture,2025-10-24T14:40:33Z,5
music/2025/oct/21/bob-vylan-interview-louis-theroux-idf-chant-glastonbury,Bob Vylan ‘not regretful’ about IDF chant at Glastonbury: ‘I’d do it again tomorrow’,"Bob Vylan frontman Bobby Vylan is “not regretful” of his “death, death to the IDF” chant at Glastonbury and said he would “do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays”. The outspoken punk duo sparked controversy when they led chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, at the festival in June. The chant was condemned by Glastonbury and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described it as “appalling hate speech”. Bob Vylan was dropped by its agency UTA, and the US state department revoked the member’s visas, forcing them to cancel a North American tour. Speaking on The Louis Theroux Podcast in his first interview since Glastonbury, Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, was asked if he would do it all again. He replied: “Oh yeah. Like what if I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes I would do it again. I’m not regretful of it. I’d do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays. He said the backlash the band had faced was “minimal compared to what people in Palestine are going through”. “I don’t want to overstate the importance of the chant,” he added. “That’s not what I’m trying to do, but if I have their support, they’re the people that I’m doing it for, they’re the people that I’m being vocal for, then what is there to regret? Oh, because I’ve upset some rightwing politician or some rightwing media?” Vylan’s conversation with Theroux was recorded on 1 October. At the start of the episode, the presenter states that it took place before the Manchester synagogue attacks on 2 October, in which two people were killed and three others injured, and before the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on 10 October. The musician said he was taken aback by the uproar sparked by the chant, and claimed members of BBC staff at Glastonbury told him on the day that the set was “fantastic”. The corporation’s executive complaints unit (ECU) has since found the BBC’s broadcast of the performance breached editorial standards in relation to harm and offence. Vylan told Theroux there was no sign of a controversy in the moment: “It wasn’t like we came off stage, and everybody was like [gasps]. It’s just normal. We come off stage. It’s normal. Nobody thought anything. Nobody. Even staff at the BBC were like ‘That was fantastic! We loved that!’” Vylan also hit back at Damon Albarn from Blur, who called the chant “one of the most spectacular misfires I’ve seen in my life” and described Vylan as “goose-stepping in tennis gear”. Albarn’s reaction was “disappointing” and “lacked self-awareness”, Vylan said. “I just want to say that categorising it as a ‘spectacular misfire’ implies that somehow the politics of the band or our stance on Palestinian liberation is not thought out,” he said. “I take great issue with the phrase ‘goose-stepping’ being used because it’s only used around Nazi Germany,” he added. “That’s it. And for him to use that language, I think is disgusting. I think his response was disgusting.” Asked what he meant by the chant “Death to the IDF,” Vylan said the chant itself was “unimportant”. “What is important is the conditions that exist to allow that chant to even take place on that stage. And I mean, the conditions that exist in Palestine. Where the Palestinian people are being killed at an alarming rate. Who cares about the chant?” he said. “Death to the IDF” rhymes, he added: “‘End, End the IDF’ does not rhyme, wouldn’t have caught on, would it? … We are there to entertain. We are there to play music. I am a lyricist. ‘Death, Death to IDF’ rhymes. Perfect chant.” Vylan also rejected claims from the Community Security Trust (CST), a monitoring and Jewish community safety organisation, that their set contributed to a spike in antisemitic incidents reported two days later. “I don’t think I have created an unsafe atmosphere for the Jewish community. If there were large numbers of people going out and going like ‘Bob Vylan made me do this’. I might go, oof, I’ve had a negative impact here,” he said. When Vylan said he thought the band had been criticised more heavily than others for speaking about the conflict, Theroux mentioned the Irish band Kneecap, who have also faced backlash for their approach to pro-Palestine messaging. “That’s an interesting one,” Vylan said, “because as with everything race comes to play a part in that we are an easier villain, no pun intended, than they are because we are already the enemy.” Press Association contributed to this report.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/21/bob-vylan-interview-louis-theroux-idf-chant-glastonbury,Music,2025-10-21T02:40:10Z,5
music/2025/sep/23/basslines-over-goalposts-cricket-club-bhangra-nights-the-gatherings-where-british-diaspora-music-really-grows,"Basslines over goalposts, cricket club bhangra nights: the gatherings where British diaspora music really grows","I don’t learn about music from record shops or curated playlists. I discover it on muddy football pitches in east London, with the smell of chips drifting from the van at half-time; in rented cricket halls in Bradford where there is always a giant urn of tea bubbling in the corner. The sounds that have shaped me as a Black British person aren’t designed by algorithms or commissioned by labels. They come from battered speakers balanced on trestle tables, bhangra basslines rattling the walls of community centres in Southall and WhatsApp threads buzzing long after everyone has gone home. I remember attending a Somali football league in east London where the match ended but no one left. The players, still in muddy boots, piled into the clubhouse to eat rice from foil trays while a DJ wired up his decks at the side of the pitch. The final whistle had barely faded before Sneakbo’s The Wave ripped across the park, the chorus bouncing off the goalposts like an anthem and propelling players and families to move. A few weeks later, in Bradford, I was in a cricket club that had become a bhangra night. Aunties juggled trays of samosas and paper cups of tea as the floor shook to the pounding rhythm of British-Asian bhangra pioneers Alaap’s take on traditional Heer Ranjha, a song older than most of the crowd but carried with fresh force through second and third-generations. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was unforgettable. And here, too, the loop revealed itself. Sport gathered the people, music deepened the connection, and that connection made space for the next track, the next party, the next young talent. I also remember the first time a track reached me through a WhatsApp group that no algorithm would ever find. A cousin in Birmingham forwarded me a digitised cassette of Hasan Cihat Örter’s Sevgiye Zaman Ver, a Turkish instrumental that sounded as if it had been recorded underwater. The file had been passed from uncle to uncle across three countries before it landed in my phone. By the end of the week, it was soundtracking a Sunday league after-party in Walthamstow. That single song created a thread of conversations, remixes and even a teenager trying to sample it for a drill track. TikTok and Spotify may shape music popularity, but virality doesn’t just exist online. My phone is always pinging with new music from outside the algorithm and across the diaspora. Aunties send gospel remixes with laughing emojis, cousins drop raw Warsaw drill tracks such as Lola by Żabson and friends digitise Somali oud tapes that are not on any streaming platform. Within hours, a playlist builds itself out of scraps, memes and masterpieces. It is chaotic, but it is magic. What excites me most about these digital and real-life spaces is how generative they are, a cycle of care and creativity that the official industry cannot replicate, no matter how much data it crunches or how many trends it tries to chase. These networks recycle energy and form their own kind of musical infrastructure. Aunties book DJs to raise money for sports kit, then the cricket fundraiser doubles as a rave. Kids test their first bars at the end of a match and get cheers from a crowd who know their names. The applause gives them confidence to come back with another verse, another set, another story. And in a Britain where public spaces are shrinking and funding for youth centres and the arts gets cut year after year, these grassroots networks feel like resistance. They are proof that joy cannot be legislated out of existence. People will always find ways to gather, to dance, to share songs that make them feel alive. Yet too often, these diasporic exchanges and cultural networks are pushed to the margins of Britain’s mainstream music narrative. Despite their energy and influence, they rarely receive the same visibility or institutional support as other scenes that emerge with commercial polish or industry connections. Instead they are written off as niche or “local”, even as their sounds quietly shape the pulse of British music. That neglect matters, because it speaks to whose voices are amplified as part of the national story, and whose contributions are left unheard. For me, these networks are the reason I fell in love with music in the first place. They show me that you do not need slick studios or industry backing to build something that matters. You just need a room, some speakers, a crowd, and the will to keep going. So if you ask me where the future of British music is being written, I will not point to TikTok or Spotify. I would point to the Morley’s fried chicken shops lit up after midnight, dancehall spilling from a car parked outside. The school sports days in east London where a Bluetooth speaker sneaks in under the teacher’s desk and suddenly the whole class is moving. The community centres that smell of carpet cleaner and curry where a DJ plugs into a socket that barely works. The football pitch that turns into a dancefloor once the floodlights go out. Because in these spaces, music and community do not just coexist. They create each other, over and over again. The future of our music is not written by algorithm. It is passed hand to hand, speaker to speaker, pitch to pitch.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/23/basslines-over-goalposts-cricket-club-bhangra-nights-the-gatherings-where-british-diaspora-music-really-grows,Music,2025-09-23T13:00:56Z,5
music/2025/sep/22/chappell-roan-new-york-concert-review,Chappell Roan review – pop’s patient princess triumphantly takes the throne in New York,"Time feels evermore like a ludicrous concept in 2025, but it especially collapses when considering the career of Chappell Roan. The Missouri-born pop artist languished in up-and-coming mode for years – I first learned of her prismatic gay club anthem Pink Pony Club via a friend’s recommendation in 2020 – only to experience one of the swiftest ascents into the mainstream I’ve ever witnessed. Just 18 months ago, she was still playing 2,000-cap amphitheaters in mid-sized cities; by summer’s end, she drew the largest crowd (more than 100,000) that Chicago’s Lollapalooza festival has ever seen. Her rise was so vertiginous – viral Tiny Desk, Grammys best new artist, festival undercard to headliner, international chart takeover – that she feels lifetimes away from the artist I saw, stunned by her own zeitgeist earthquake at New York’s Governors Ball in June of last year. Her return to New York at Forest Hills stadium this weekend, her first live shows in the US in a year, thus represents a homecoming of sorts, and a victory lap for the occasionally rocky journey into the stratosphere. Her eight “pop-up” shows this fall, billed as the Visions of Damsels &amp; Other Dangerous Things tour, span the geographical linchpins of her music: four shows in New York, site of sexual awakenings (Naked in Manhattan) and devastating breakups (new single The Subway, the night’s pre-eminent vehicle for Roan’s torrential belt); two in Kansas City, Missouri, a few hours from her hometown of Willard; and two in Los Angeles, where Roan forged the joyously queer and infectiously cheeky pop of her debut and still only studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess. It’s a testament to the potency of Roan’s maximalist sound, chock-full of sexually frank lyrics, baroque feelings and lavish camp, that a 93-minute set containing almost every song she’s recorded had the feeling of a greatest hits show. Roan was allegedly not “feeling 100” on Sunday night – “I have a migraine, so I can’t bang my head super hard, but that’s kinda my thing, so pretend I bang my head a lot tonight,” she said before nominally teaching the YMCA-style Hot To Go! dance to 13,000 devotees, ranging from young girls to queer twentysomethings to a middle-aged man in front of me texting his mom “I love her!!!!” mid-show. But whatever felt off to her did not translate in a show that felt as triumphant as it did laidback – an artist gone through the wringer, finally relaxing into superstardom. You know from the second she appears in a whimsically gothic castle, styled as both musketeer and princess and bemoaning a boring man’s “fugly jeans”, that Roan has finally hit her big-tent stride. A chameleon explicitly indebted to drag – several queens opened Sunday’s show, as on most other dates – Roan, born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, played every other royal role in a loosely fairytale-themed show: damsel, knight, jester, queen of the castle high-kicking the point of out every line; supplicant to the guitar heroes of her all-female, 70s rock-styled band; heir to the lineage of bombastic, unapologetic female showmanship when introducing Heart’s Nancy Wilson for a deafening, and transcendent, rendition of Barracuda. Roan is easily one of the strongest vocalists of her pop generation, though she was occasionally overwhelmed by the joyous din – whether for illness or celebration, she often let the audience take over. I lost her voice entirely in the pop-rock deluge that is The Subway, her hearty belt subsumed in a cascade of devotion from fans to singer to subject. That’s befitting a show that, while exuberant and celebratory, still managed to feel casual and intimate, more relaxed than the last time she performed on US soil. “I’m like really hard on myself, I’m really, really hard on myself, for performing … I can’t do 100% today. I guess that’s OK, I’ll have fun,” she said while seated on a throne for Coffee, evincing a hard-earned and endearing looseness after white-knuckling into the stratosphere with the attendant stalkers and social media controversies. (Vocally, her “less than 100%” is another’s 10,000%.) But for all the pop bombast – and I prefer Roan’s more-is-more, unleashed inner child performance style – it was on the slow-burn California, the night’s penultimate song, that she got me. A homesick ballad written and released in 2020, as her first foray into pop music faltered and before she returned to Missouri, the track is now at extreme odds with the supernova Roan has become. And yet, in a brief moment of stirring a cappella – “I stretched myself across four states / New lands, west coast, where my dreams lay” – her voice held all that once was: big dreams and disillusionment, conflicted yearning for a dying place, a distinctly midwestern sense of obligation and humility that does not go away. It was an emotional jolt in an otherwise effervescent show – a hymn and a reminder that she, and many others in the crowd, had come a long, long way.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/22/chappell-roan-new-york-concert-review,Music,2025-09-22T18:54:31Z,5

music/2025/oct/02/shes-leaning-into-the-idea-that-her-image-is-a-gilded-fantasy-how-taylor-swift-embraced-the-showgirl,‘She’s leaning into the idea that her image is a gilded fantasy’: how Taylor Swift embraced the showgirl,"Taylor Swift has gone through many evolutions over her 20-year career: the guitar-strummer of her 2006 debut, the wide-eyed New Yorker on 1989, the introspective storyteller of Folklore and Midnights. Her two-year Eras tour established her as the defining entertainer of her generation, and after her recent engagement to American footballer Travis Kelce, one of its biggest celebrities. Now, after an unexpectedly brief hiatus, Swift returns with her 12th album in yet another guise: a showgirl. Swift made The Life of a Showgirl with Swedish super-producers Max Martin and Shellback while touring Europe last year. She described the project as a tribute to her “joyful, wild, dramatic” life as an entertainer, and a look “behind the scenes” of the Eras spectacle. Album imagery by fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott shows Swift bejewelled with diamantes, fishnet tights, fur and feathered headdresses. “Swift has crafted a different persona for pretty much every album, so it’s not such a surprise that we’re seeing a new side of her,” says Drew Nobile, an associate professor of music theory at the University of Oregon. But why a showgirl – and why now? It is not as much of a clash with Swift’s trademark girl-next-door relatability as it may seem. “She’s leaning into the idea that her public image is a gilded fantasy,” Nobile says, allowing her to present herself as both “the billionaire pop star who dazzles arenas every night, and the same old girl beneath the costumes. It would ring hollow if she just came back with a down-to-earth album of personal songs, as if the Eras tour never happened.” Even the title The Life of a Showgirl, he says, “seems to be suggesting that behind the sequins is a real woman.” Swift isn’t the first pop star to draw from the 19th-century showgirl tradition. For her Man! I Feel Like a Woman! video, riffing on Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love, Shania Twain donned a top hat and tuxedo jacket to transform the original’s sleaze into sex appeal and female empowerment. Lady Marmalade, from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, emphasised showgirls’ solidarity. Kylie Minogue chose to celebrate her “long-term relationship” with fans with her art deco-inspired Showgirl tour of 2005; Lady Gaga acknowledged her debt to cabaret at last year’s Paris Olympics. Among pop’s new generation, Sabrina Carpenter’s skits draw from vaudeville while Addison Rae often wears sequins, tulle and lingerie-inspired looks. For pop stars such as these, the showgirl offers both stage-ready looks and historical context – but she has never been mere spectacle, argues Alison J Carr, the Sheffield-based author of Viewing Pleasure and Being a Showgirl. Each showgirl extends the tradition and reflects the “pleasures and anxieties” of her time, she says. “There is no original showgirl: she’s always a quotation.” *** The iconic showgirl emerged from 19th-century social change: industrialisation and the shift to the city, the birth of nightlife and women’s increasing visibility in public. After emerging in Parisian music halls and cabarets, the style spread to England, where John Tiller’s legendary troupe popularised what was called “precision dance”. The “kickline” of performers standing shoulder-to-shoulder, and their synchronised can-can dances, all seemed to reflect the dawning machine age and cast women as symbols of modernity, Carr says. “Forms of progress, for ill and for good, [were] showing up in what the showgirls were doing.” Introduced to the US, the showgirl was quickly absorbed into the emerging entertainment business and “became part of Americana”, Carr says. Producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr developed the revues’ winking mix of sex appeal, glamour, comedy and theatrical performance. But by the 1970s and second-wave feminism, showgirls had been spurned along with beauty queens as creations of the male gaze, “dehumanising and objectifying”, Carr says. There was little acknowledgment of showgirls as skilled professionals. Yet many were classically trained dancers, and performed in 2-3in heels and wore costumes weighing as much as 22lbs (10kgs). Most shows required them to be 5ft 8in or taller, so as to not appear swamped on stage; strong legs, back and core muscles were a must. “There’s a lot of steps, the dancers are running up and down … it’s incredibly physical,” says Carr. When animated by the performer, however, the costumes’ glitz and glamour actually serve to highlight her humanity and talent, Carr says. “All that embellishment is saying that you’re important, you deserve to be seen, you’ve got something to say.” Carr recalls seeing a troupe in Los Angeles, made up of women with different looks and builds. “You could see that all of them had just decided: ‘I’m going to be that beautiful woman in the kickline.’ It’s not contingent on what you look like, what you’re wearing – it’s that inner commitment ... You’re audacious because you know you’re that good.” That would certainly seem to appeal to Swift, known for her formidable work ethic and ambition to be the biggest and the best. To prepare for the Eras tour and three-hour shows night after night, Swift sang the entire setlist aloud while running on a treadmill, daily, and did three months of dance training. That professionalism, and commitment to putting on a stellar performance, defines the showgirl, Carr says. “You’ll see recordings of performers, and films, but this is the ephemera – the show is really the live encounter.” Likewise, Swift’s Eras Tour film was pitched as a way to relive the experience, not as as replacement; many fans attended more than once. *** But what does a real showgirl think of Swift’s self-coronation? “She absolutely looks like a showgirl,” says Lou Anne Chessik. Over her 12-year career, Chessik performed in Jubilee! – the longest-running revue in Las Vegas and the inspiration for this year’s Pamela Anderson drama The Last Showgirl – as well as other extravaganzas in Vegas, Reno and Tokyo. “I loved being a showgirl, wearing all the amazing costumes, our camaraderie backstage,” says Chessik. But it was demanding work. Chessik worked six-month contracts, performing six to seven nights a week and two shows a night (three on Saturdays). She was even limited in how much time she could spend outdoors: “We could not have tan lines … but it probably saved my skin,” she says. In 2007 Chessik founded the Showgirl Legacy Foundation to preserve those performers’ historic significance. She was delighted to see Swift posing in one of the original ensembles from Jubilee!, designed by Bob Mackie for the show’s “Jewel finale”. The bra, undergarments and armbands are described as French wirework, with set stones and nude fabric backing for a “nude illusion”. (Carpenter has also worn Mackie’s vintage designs.) “I love that Swift appreciates the art of costuming from our era,” says Chessik. She also looks the part in the album artwork, between her 5ft 10in height and her “perfect” red lipstick, just like that worn by Chessik and her colleagues. But, she adds, “our hair was always pinned up and pulled back … and we never sat in our costumes.” More than her stature or styling, Swift embodies the showgirl essence, Chessik says: “She is professional, charismatic, talented. ” She points to Swift’s comic timing in the Shake It Off video (“it reminds me of I Love Lucy”), the storytelling to her shows, and the hard work that goes into them. She has “absolutely” earned the right to call herself a showgirl, Chessik concludes, along with Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and other contemporary entertainers. “They are the top performers of their time and genre – like we were.” Certainly the “big showgirl spectacle”, at least, now belongs to stadium pop, Carr agrees. Showgirls still exist, often in coalition with drag, cabaret and burlesque performers, but performance opportunities and venues tend to be small-scale, independently run and as such vulnerable to closure. “The contemporary showgirl has a bit of precarity to her,” she says. The same cannot be said of Swift, who is on her way to her second billion. If anything, Carr suggests, her wealth complicates her claim to the showgirl, who is typically self-made and anti-elitist. “To become a showgirl is not something that you’re born into – you become it, you opt into it.” With so many present-day performers “labouring in the margins” and showgirl history at risk of being lost, Swift might consider putting resources towards protecting the tradition, Carr suggests. Without that extra step, she risks coming across as simply “showing off”. After all, most showgirls performed alongside dozens of others. Former chorus girls have told Carr of feeling empowered by “having many sisters”. Chessik recalls performing in casts of more than 100; even when there were leads, “not many people knew them by name”. As “the lone showgirl”, Swift has skipped solidarity and gone straight to commanding the stage solo. “She is crowning herself, coronating herself, because she’s got everything that this era wants,” Carr says. But, she adds, anyone can learn how to embrace their power and embody the showgirl’s spirit. Indeed, relative to the goddesses and queens to which female pop stars are often compared, she is closer to earth and even accessible. “It does take talent, panache, charisma, refining your craft, all of those things … but you don’t need to be a billionaire.”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/02/shes-leaning-into-the-idea-that-her-image-is-a-gilded-fantasy-how-taylor-swift-embraced-the-showgirl,Music,2025-10-02T10:51:07Z,4
music/2025/sep/25/punjabi-disco-kuljit-mohinder-kaur-bhamra-british-asian-dance-record,‘The label made 500 copies – we sold it in corner shops’: the story behind lost dance music classic Punjabi Disco,"‘Punjabi Disco is the holy grail of British Asian music,” DJ and label boss Raghav Mani says. “It’s a miracle this record exists. For decades it has been lost to the world, but now we can hear it in all its glory – the album that birthed the British Asian dancefloor.” Recorded in London in 1982, the nine-track album combines producer Kuljit Bhamra’s searing synthesiser melodies and hammering drum machine rhythms with the Punjabi-language folk singing of his classically trained mother, Mohinder Kaur Bhamra. Part early acid house experiment, part north Indian tradition and part disco-funk, the record was a futuristic outlier: the south Asian fusion sounds of bhangra were only just beginning; the mainstream crossover music of the Asian underground was more than a decade away; and the British Asian diaspora were largely relegated to meeting at weddings and community events, rather than at the disco. Limited to only 500 copies, Punjabi Disco disappeared from circulation almost as quickly as it was released, leaving Mohinder to go back to singing at Sikh weddings and Kuljit to producing bhangra records by groups such as Heera. In the decades since, rare copies have materialised online for thousands of dollars but it has otherwise vanished into obscurity. That was until Mani stumbled on a new lead. “When you’re a record collector you can develop this jaded feeling that you’ve seen and heard everything,” he says. “Except, in 2022 my friend Massimo called me and was so excited about this new discovery that he had to play it to me over the phone. Even down the line, I could tell it was something singular and indefinable in its sound. He said it was called Punjabi Disco and he had just bought the last copy in existence, directly from Kuljit.” Mani and his business partner Filip Nikolic immediately decided to see if Kuljit was willing to release a reissue on their archival label Naya Beat. “It was a three-year process, from first hearing the record to Kuljit finding the original master tapes in his house and digitising them before they completely degraded,” Mani says. “During that time, we discovered that not only is it an incredible-sounding album that more people need to hear but it also has a crazy story behind its making.” Moving to London in the early 1960s, after a childhood spent in India, Uganda and Kenya, Mohinder built a reputation as a spiritual singer. She was the first woman in her community to sing at local Sikh gurdwara events and progressed to performing at wedding receptions. Her family provided instrumental backing, including Kuljit who accompanied on tabla from the age of six. As the 1970s approached, though, Mohinder began to be uncomfortable about the gender segregation she witnessed in the crowd. “South Asians weren’t living in England in large numbers and they faced a lot of racism, so there weren’t many places for them to gather,” she says. “One of the few spaces they could enjoy themselves were wedding receptions, but every time we would get up to sing, the women would typically be in another room and only the men were allowed to dance. I felt it wasn’t fair and so I started to invite them in.” By the new decade, Mohinder and the Bhamra family band had become notorious for enabling the first mixed British Asian dancefloors and the songs in their repertoire began to change to suit their crowd. “There was one guy who dressed like an Indian Elvis who used to crash the weddings to watch us play. If we could get him moving, I knew we were on to something,” Kuljit laughs. “By the time Saturday Night Fever came out in 1978, disco mania was happening and I could see people in the crowd even more eager to dance. I decided we should write our own music to reflect that.” Armed with Roland’s first synthesiser, the SH-1000, 22-year-old Kuljit began recording demos on reel-to-reel tape that he would share with his mother at the kitchen table every evening. She wrote her own lyrics to the beats, finding an aptitude for penning yearning romance narratives. Soon Kuljit had enough material for the record. He booked a local studio, which happened to be run by Roxy Music’s bass player Rik Kenton and, along with his mother, 11-year-old brother Ambi on the drum machine and bass-playing friend Trevor Michael Georges, they laid down the tracks. “It was a joy to record as everything just clicked,” Kuljit says. “I always treated my mother’s voice as an instrument, like a flute or keyboard, so the sound of the record was really cohesive while also feeling totally new. We thought people would love it.” Yet, months after being told by executives at EMI India that the record would be released, the family stumbled upon a cassette with the title Punjabi Disco being sold in a Southall record shop, featuring a different singer and new songs. Kuljit saw it as a direct theft of their idea. “We were devastated,” he says. “We managed to argue our case and got a distribution deal but they only pressed 500 copies that we barely saw. I actually ended up biking copies of the few records they gave us to local cornershops to see if they might shift some there!” It wasn’t until Kuljit was approached by Mani that he went looking for the master tapes again and even discovered a new unreleased track, the rollicking disco-funk number Dohai Ni Dohai, which wouldn’t fit on to the original 12-inch pressing. “It was all made to get people dancing and the tragedy is that we never got to play it live after it was recorded,” Kuljit says. “Since it’s now been remastered and remixed, a new generation can finally enjoy it for its original purpose, while my mum can get her dues for being such a radical.” “It’s incredibly brave for first- and second-generation migrants to make an album like this that breaks all conventions, especially in the context of the era’s racism and sexism,” Mani adds. “Mohinder is very traditional in many ways and an expert Punjabi folk singer but she’s also an advocate for women’s rights – she doesn’t fit into an easy category and neither does her music.” Now 89, Mohinder is no longer performing but she is happy to hear herself once more. “I was young and my voice sounds good,” she laughs. “I’m proud of what my boys achieved and I hope people can enjoy and move to this music again.” Punjabi Disco is out on 31 October on Naya Beat Records.",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/25/punjabi-disco-kuljit-mohinder-kaur-bhamra-british-asian-dance-record,Music,2025-09-25T07:00:29Z,4
culture/2025/sep/25/garden-reflexxx-the-10-funniest-things-we-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet,Garden Reflexxx: the 10 funniest things we have ever seen (on the internet),"As hosts of FBi Radio’s Movies Movies Movies, our goal in life and love is to free cinema from pretty privilege. As film-makers-cum-critics we’ve spent years unlearning “industry standard” to find the essence of movies, and have accumulated an oeuvre proving time and time again that cinema is, actually, all around. So, in preparation for our upcoming film festival at the Sydney Opera House, we went Tomb Raider to mine the oceanic crust of our search history, which filled an orange hard drive, so we’ve focused on what worked for us in this particular moment of time. Much like Tame Impala, most of these videos are secretly solo acts: usually Women on the Verge of a Mental Breakthrough using available equipment like an iPhone. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Ask two film-makers to write a listicle and you give them a job for life. 1. Puppycodes Puppycodes is a largely dormant Instagram data bank but Alice Barker is, and was, the hottest hacker who defined an era. She scraped the internet using code for the most specific videos that bordered on dangerous but always felt cute. Like most of the funniest people she has also deeply beneficent; she started support.fm, a non-profit bail fund for trans and gender nonconforming people in jail and detention. Every video hits a very different sweet spot, they’re all worth the soft/deep schadenfreude, and she’s the slow cinema of the grid. Did this description convince you of the humour in her work? Like The Bear’s Emmy eligibility, Puppycodes is both a drama and a comedy. 2. Caitupdate: New lip palette! Does MUA stand for makeup artist, or is it a kissing sound spelled out? Here, Macy Rodman imitates transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner trying a new lip palette. Caitupdate is just one of the many and varied ways Macy has a stranglehold on us. Her music is amazing, her podcast Nymphowars is the funniest thing to ever be released, she’s an incredible actor and no one is funnier than her live. Macy generously gave us her music for our first feature film, Grape Steak, came to our low-key screening at Spectacle theatre, and I know this all sounds like a brag but while we have the Guardian platform we’d like to add that she also hosted us in Greenwich Village to watch the season two premiere of And Just Like That … and followed us around New York for a whole day trying to find us the Interview magazine with Lana on the cover. #MUA #IThoughThatWasAKissingSoundSpelledOutButIGuessItStandsForMakeupArtist 3. Lushious Massacr: The Herstory of the Piggy Dolls is Being Documented Who said a makeup artist couldn’t make cinematic experiences honey!? Officer of the law AKA full-time dragvestigator Lushious Massacr addresses the camera while examining corners of near-dead malls and morals across America. Every Lushious video is a generous work of archiveology (frequently shot horizontally) blending humour, activism and sales advice with a hint of privacy invasion. She scouts the public sphere uncovering relatable ways of seeing. We’re being earnest because she’s a film-maker, when so many are just “a face” on screen. She’s worth falling into the pit honey, the pits of hell (your phone). Her sound design is second to none. “Don’t do it little girl” has become a mantra, “Brick” has become a warning, “Hiiiiiii!” should be the Pantone colour of the year™. 4. Gal Palz episode two: Another Simple Day With Zero Consequences Gal Palz was an audaciously vasodilated cartoon, much like the Latvian drama Flow only without animals, budget, glory or Oscars. The Covid era was a renaissance for resourceful animation and Gal Palz was bravery incarnate at a time when the world was turning a blind eye to anything other than handheld neorealist sketch comics doing dramedy. This miniseries takes the Bechdel test backwards to an era when closeted gay boys dreamed of female friend groups plagued by inane problems. Underrated and overcooked, it had a short life but a treasured one. 5. Patti Harrison on Triple J: ‘I’m not telling you shit’ By this point our list has to apply for American citizenship. But comedy from the States still works overseas, as proven by Patti Harrison’s press tour in Australia. Here, she appears on Triple J to challenge censorship. We originally programmed Patti Harrison at one of our own film festivals: a short video where she falls out of a cupboard in a dress, on to the floor and gives awards to cars. It was called Congratulations. Everything Patti does feels cinematic, especially putting Australian comedians in their place. One day we hope luxury coffee table book publisher Taschen releases a Kurt Cobain-style book of Patti’s bedtime journals. 6. Belinda Furniture Catherine Cohen’s character Belinda Furniture goes sex warfare in No More Blowjobs. It’s her call to arms and abstinence. Belinda teaches us the power to withhold is deeper than any religious fasting. Cat is more than just a gay best friend: she’s also the best friend a gay guy can have. We’ve been co-therapising through her medical podcast Seek Treatment for years, and witnessed a mosh-scream at her cameo in Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value when it played the State Theatre during the Sydney film festival this year. As experimental film-makers we’re obsessed with alternative streaming platforms, so we also recommend Catherine’s special Come For Me on Veeps, which is, in fact, available in Australia. To quote Denise Richards in Scary Movie 3: “No sex!” 7. Goodbye, Brooklyn Our manager advised us to “mention someone on your Opera House lineup”, so without fail we chose Goodbye, Brooklyn. Don’t switch off: it’s a comedy short film set in New York. While the world plays catch-up to Girls in its six-season entirety, save yourself the time and condense apartment anomie into this gorgeous film that answers the question: how do we move? Witness neighbourhood gaslighting, delusional self-tapes, sociological precision and the most visually hypnotic prop to appear in film: a commercial laundry conveyor. It’s Failure to Launch but backwards. It’s something from your bookmarks to put on during gay guy music video hour that’s more cared for than a meme but less commitment than an episode. Say it with us: “I am! Who I wanna be … when I wanna be it!” 8. Candis Cayne as God Warrior at TEAze Me Sundays! For some reason Jen thinks we need to give context to this performance of the most famous monologue in the history of Bride Swap. But does this really need an intro? In an age where everyone is going into spiritual warfare this video is a catharsis. Candis, who you might know from the Caitlyn Jenner reality series I Am Cait, hits on every level. It’s a ritual, it’s a celebration: it’s a beautifully layered performance and it’s dangerous (see: running on the street!). This kind of raw documentation is addictive to watch because it captures a moment in time – in the club. This video is one of the reasons we spent so much time recording performances around Sydney’s queer clubs. We have hard drives full of Wednesday nights at the Bearded Tit (vale) and weekends at the Red Rattler (get your sound proofing honey!) or even a Celebrity Big Brother re-enactment at the Ace hotel. One day the National Film and Sound Archive will contact our manager. 9. Banned Calvin Klein sexy jeans commercials with Max Jenkins This video is hard to watch, but alienating curation is part of our curatorial practice, especially if it was shot on DV with a spotlight. “Banned Calvin Klein sexy jeans commercials” captures the energy of being a cinephile in Sydney during fashion week. The world turns upside down and even though you feel on most days like you’re a centred, gorgeous and stylish angel, you’re reminded that oversharing gives most people the ick, and everyone is excited to be featured in GQ. That’s perfect, that’s modelling. Sydney is a concept, not a geography. 10. ‘Cook My Meat!’ Lisa from Temecula on Saturday Night Live Saturday Night Live is like Triple J: you can age out but it always stays the same. To honour Ego Nwodim’s elegant departure from the cast we revisit Cook My Meat. There’s actually too many sketches to choose from that she has performed in, but it has to be this one. People are incredibly proud to denounce things: like seeing a movie and saying “the cinematography was beautiful” or “I don’t get comedy”. People love to drag up that one receipt of a friend of a friend making a faux pas 10 years ago as a fact, or agree objectively using sentences they read online as a conversation starter. Thankfully, we don’t suffer from this and, week in, week out, during a season of Saturday Night Live we will watch all of the sketches (except Weekend Update) and find something funny. When Jen first moved to Sydney there was a group of people who would congregate in Camperdown Park, stand in a circle and laugh hysterically for an hour. It was disturbing to stumble through on the way to an early shift after a late night. There are so many reasons not to laugh but it’s still important to clear the way for one to happen, because without laughter there’s no tears.

culture/2025/nov/04/late-night-hosts-jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers,Jon Stewart on Trump’s Gatsby party: ‘The theme was apparently gross income inequality’,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party held just hours before millions of Americans lost their food stamp benefits. Jon Stewart On the Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked House speaker Mike Johnson’s insistence that Trump is “desperate for Snap benefits to flow to the American people”, even as his administration let the largest food assistance program in the nation, supporting around 42 million Americans, lapse during the government shutdown. Stewart played a clip of Johnson assuring that Trump “is a big-hearted president”. “Is he? Big-hearted? Loves us?” Stewart replied. “Because again, and maybe I’m misinterpreting it, but he did just recently dump diarrhea on all of us.” Stewart then played Trump’s infamous AI video in which he is depicted dumping feces on New York protesters. “He cares a lot about the American people,” Stewart deadpanned. “Maybe that is out of love. I don’t know.” Even worse, Trump held a Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago this weekend, hours before the Snap benefits expired. The party “once and for all shows that Donald Trump doesn’t give a fuck about even looking like he gives a fuck at all”, Stewart declared. “On the very night Snap benefits ended, Trump threw a Great Gatsby-themed ode to decadence and hedonism that even Jeffrey Epstein would have thought was a little over the top,“ he continued. “There were dancers, costumes, champagne – a wonderful celebration where the theme was apparently gross income inequality. “The slogan of the party, as people were losing their food benefits was, I shit you not, ‘a little party never killed nobody,’” he fumed. “Did you even read the Great Gatsby?! Spoiler alert, the party killed somebody! Two-bodies! How do you not know that? I knew that, and I’ve only read the Cliff notes. “Usually at a time of national suffering, there’s a generally accepted principle in leadership that you at least pretend to feel the pain of the people that you represent,” he added. “But this president seems to go out of his way to let struggling Americans know that he is doing very well.” Stewart pointed to Trump’s $300m gilded ballroom project, as yet another example of his lack of pretense. “Your premiums may be going up, tariffs may be shutting down your small businesses, you may be losing your food assistance, but it’ll all OK because Donald Trump is building a ballroom that looks like the inside of Marie Antoinette’s vagina,” he joked. Stephen Colbert “There are so many bad parts of a government shutdown, but the worst so far is that as of this weekend, nearly 42 million Americans have lost their food stamp benefits,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show on the 34th day of the government shutdown, with no end in sight. “No one should understand the importance of daily meals more than Donald Trump,” he added. “Hungry is his favorite emotion. It’s his whole thing – Trump and food is like JFK and sex, or Thomas Jefferson and sex, or Lincoln and his hat, which he had sex with.” Last week, the Trump administration claimed that it couldn’t use US Department of Agriculture emergency funds for Snap benefits. But on Friday, a federal judge directed the administration to use them anyway for the month of November. “Of course, like all good news during the Trump administration, he managed to make it bad,” said Colbert, as the administration has since said that it will only partially fund Snap, and it could take months because it declined to dip into other contingency pots to find the full $8bn required to fund the program. “So Trump and his people are sitting on a pile of money while American children go hungry, just so they can put pressure on Democrats,” Colbert summarized. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host noted that Trump’s “disapproval rating” is 63%. “And what do you do when you have a terrible approval rating? You throw the most ill-timed, tone-deaf Halloween party imaginable,” he said of Trump’s Gatsby bash – “a theme you would select only if you’ve never read the Great Gatsby. “You know, throwing a party at your private golf club where the theme is rich white people hours before millions of Americans are set to lose their food assistance might be the Trumpiest Trump move of all time,” he said. “It felt like the last big bash before the Epstein files come out.” Nevertheless, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.” “That’s true, he doesn’t want them to go hungry,” Kimmel responded. “He just wants them to lose their health insurance. He wants them to eat, but health insurance? No.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers touched on Trump’s redecoration of a White House bathroom to befit his garish style – all white marble, with gold finishes. Trump called the changes “very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln”. “I would love to know how Trump came to the conclusion that the changes were ‘appropriate for the time of Lincoln’,” Meyers laughed. “Does he think Lincoln was a high-roller who loved gold trash cans? Every story I’ve heard about Lincoln is like ‘he did his homework with a lump of coal on the back of a shovel in the pouring rain.’ Or ‘did you know he put himself through law school by eating mud for eight cents a day?’ But to hear Trump talk, Lincoln was like, what, best friends with Hugh Hefner?” Trump has also posted repeatedly about the renovation on Truth Social. “Look, it’s never normal to obsess over a new bathroom, but it’s especially crazy to obsess over a luxurious new bathroom right as tens of millions of Americans are facing uncertainty over food assistance,” said Meyers. “What we should be talking about instead is the government shutdown you’re not solving or the food assistance you refuse to fund,” he added. “Working families are struggling while you renovate your bathroom or you build your ballroom, and that’s why your approval ratings are in the toilet.”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/04/late-night-hosts-jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers,Culture,2025-11-04T16:52:09Z,3
music/2025/sep/29/danny-thompson-obituary,Danny Thompson obituary,"Afounder member of the British folk-rock band Pentangle, the double bass player Danny Thompson also added depth and resonance to recordings by artists as varied as Nick Drake and Kate Bush, Cliff Richard and Everything But the Girl, Graham Coxon and John Martyn – to name a handful among the hundreds of sessions he played on from the early 1960s into the 21st century. Thompson, who has died aged 86, was a musician’s musician. His fluid playing enriched the albums Five Leaves Left (1969) by Drake and Solid Air (1973) by Martyn, and he went on to form a long working relationship with Martyn, and, later, the singer-songwriter Richard Thompson (no relation). It was Lonnie Donegan’s hits of the mid-50s that first inspired Thompson as a young teenager to build a tea-chest bass and join a skiffle band. Working Soho clubs and US airbases in the 60s, he built a name as a capable bassist, and in 1964 he joined Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated. As a band leader, Korner brought together a wealth of young British talent, including Ginger Baker, Charlie Watts, Eric Clapton and Brian Jones, and his stewardship led to Thompson engaging with many rising stars at Korner’s Marquee club base. He became the bassist of choice of jazz musicians such as John McLaughlin and Tubby Hayes, and folk artists such as Davey Graham. In 1967, he and the drummer Terry Cox, also from Blues Incorporated, joined the guitarists Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, and vocalist Jacqui McShee, to complete the lineup of Pentangle. While initially branded a “folk” band, Pentangle employed jazz and classical elements as they reimagined traditional songs, with Thompson playing an important part in that experimentation. The various members having established their names in the Soho folk and rock scene, the band’s first public concert, at the Royal Festival Hall in 1967, was a huge success, as was their debut album, The Pentangle, released the following year. Their 1969 album, Basket of Light, was even bigger commercially, containing the hit single Light Flight, used as the theme for a BBC TV drama, Take Three Girls. It was not the first theme tune for Thompson, who, having realised that recording sessions were more financially rewarding than playing live – “all the money I used to earn on jazz gigs used to get blown before I got home” – had in 1964 played on the recording for the theme music of the TV series Thunderbirds. After Pentangle split in 1972, Thompson chose not to join another group, but to concentrate on playing sessions – the record producer Joe Boyd having already paired him with Drake for Five Leaves Left, did the same with Martyn and Solid Air. Thompson and Martyn were kindred spirits, heavy drinkers who delighted in displays of disruptive, drunken behaviour while touring. Alcoholism would affect both men and led to a notable drop-off in session work for Thompson. However, in the late 70s, Thompson sobered up, and the reverence his recordings with Drake and Martyn were now held in eventually found him again in demand as a session player: in the mid-80s David Sylvian, Bush, Talk Talk, The The, Everything But the Girl, Coxon and Skin all employed him for his lyrical playing. In 1987 Thompson released his debut solo album, Whatever, leading a jazz trio playing the muscular fusion he loved. He released five more low-key solo jazz albums over the next quarter century, alongside continuing to work prodigiously with others, most notably Richard Thompson, the two veterans of the 60s folk scene recording 14 albums together. Last year, he performed at Richard’s 75th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Danny was born in Teignmouth, Devon. He never knew his father, a miner who enrolled in the Royal Navy at the start of the second world war and was killed in action. Danny’s sister died soon after and he and his mother moved to Battersea, south-west London, where he attended Salesian college. He excelled in boxing and football as well as playing a variety of instruments, before settling on the upright bass. Having left school and home aged 15, Thompson earned a living playing bass in Soho strip clubs. After a year, he began working the American airbase circuit. Aged 18, he was arrested for failing to turn up for national service, and three days before being sent to Winchester barracks, married his girlfriend, Daphne Davis. He was then posted to Penang, Malaysia, for two years, where, against orders, he became involved with the local music scene. Returning to England in 1963 he took a job backing the American singer Roy Orbison – playing electric bass for the only time in his life – on a UK tour while watching headliners the Beatles kick off Beatlemania. In 1964 he spent £5 on buying his acoustic bass, Victoria – which he used his entire career – before joining Korner’s Blues Incorporated. Thompson was known for his warmth and good humour. He continued to practise for an hour a day. His mantra remained: “Music is like a religion, if you want to do something you have to work at it, you have to practise.” After embracing sobriety, Thompson set up Hero Productions to produce TV documentaries. His 1983 wildlife film A Passion to Protect (directed by Roy Deverell) won a Hugo award at the Chicago film festival. He converted to Islam in 1990, taking the Muslim name Hamza, and in 1999 he was interviewed for the BBC TV series Faces of Islam. The following year he travelled to Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem as the presenter of the documentary The Furthest Mosque. Thompson underwent major heart surgery in 1998, during which he suffered a stroke. Three months after his operation he organised an all-star charity concert in Sarajevo and he continued performing until ill health forced him to slow down several years ago. Thompson’s first marriage ended in divorce in the late 70s. In 1990 he married his partner Sylvia. She survives him, as does his son, Danny Jr, from his first marriage. • Daniel Henry Edward Thompson, musician and film producer, born 4 April 1939; died 23 September 2025",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/29/danny-thompson-obituary,Music,2025-09-29T16:00:47Z,3
music/2025/nov/05/jack-dejohnette-obituary,Jack DeJohnette obituary,"In improvisational music, ungoverned by conductors or sacrosanct scores, and given to abrupt shifts of direction on the whims of performers, drummers are often the intuitive navigators. One of the most creative and viscerally thrilling exponents of that pivotal jazz art was Jack DeJohnette, the percussionist, pianist, composer and bandleader, who has died aged 83. DeJohnette’s CV glitters with the names of the biggest jazz stars of the second half of the 20th century, and with good reason. In his youth, he played genres from R&amp;B to free-jazz in his hometown, Chicago (alongside some of the innovative founders of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians – AACM – and occasionally playing in Sun Ra’s Arkestra), before joining the most widely celebrated of early jazz-rock fusion groups, led by the saxophonist Charles Lloyd and including a then-unknown young pianist called Keith Jarrett. DeJohnette then contributed to Miles Davis’s landmark early-1970s electric bands (the trumpet star’s improvisations taking off over what he called the drummer’s “deep groove”, which in Davis’s inner world meant a tightrope walk between rhythmic precision and unpredictability), but his resourceful subtlety in quieter acoustic settings was never blunted by those heavy-hitting environments. The proof lay in DeJohnette’s sensitive accompaniment of two virtuoso jazz pianists – Bill Evans, in 1968-69, and Jarrett, in his much-loved Standards Trio from 1983 to 2014. DeJohnette also formed and led his own bands, New Directions and Special Edition, from the early 80s, notably on a series of fine horn-dominated albums with the saxophonists David Murray and Arthur Blythe, and featuring his own considerable jazz-piano skills alongside his own emerging compositional voice. In his later years he toured and recorded occasionally as a solo pianist. The experience of DeJohnette live onstage was always enthralling, but his charisma was never a distraction from whatever music he was there to bring to life. Not only could he make a regular drumkit sound bigger and more sonically resourceful, but he could also make it sound entrancingly harmonious – partly by technique, and partly by meticulous attention to its tuning and design. If the band around him was playing a brisk blues, DeJohnette might eventually drag its tempo way down to a lament, in bumpy decelerating rolls, sudden wrong-footing pauses, and lurching snare-drum blows, like somebody crossing a stream on increasingly wide-spaced stones. On uptempo swingers, he could sustain a blur of surging cymbal patterns scattered with offbeat snare-drum smacks and clatters that seemed to draw both the band and the audience into leaning closer in, as if every emerging moment might be unmissable. An athletic, muscular drummer who played the kit at arm’s length as if boxing with it, he could maintain thundering funk/rock grooves for long stretches, as he often did for Davis on dark, turbulent sessions, such as Live Evil and Live at the Fillmore East in 1970. But in Jarrett’s sublimely lyrical acoustic trios, his sensitivities to tone-colour as well as rhythm, coupled with the all-round musicality and compositional sense of the sophisticated pianist he had learned to be from childhood, confirmed why he was in demand for so many jazz and global music stars over the years. Born in Chicago’s South Side, Jack was the only child of Eva (nee Wood) and Jack DeJohnette Sr. Raised by his maternal grandmother, he began taking piano lessons at around the age of four, and his musical aptitudes were nurtured by his uncle, Roy Wood, a radio DJ, who would play him records by Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday. As a teenager, he began singing doo-wop, and playing rock piano modelled on Fats Domino in local bands – but was returned to jazz by the late 50s hits of the pianist Ahmad Jamal and, particularly, Jamal’s quietly masterly drummer Vernel Fournier. DeJohnette picked up percussion fast by listening to the era’s star drummers on record (notably Max Roach, Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones), and practising their ideas on an abandoned kit in his grandmother’s basement, and by the early 60s he was good enough to play with local heroes such as Sun Ra and the saxophonist Eddie Harris, and to successfully sit in with the emerging avant-jazz genius John Coltrane. Chicago’s AACM was a laboratory for originals including Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill and Roscoe Mitchell, and it was Muhal Richard Abrams, co-founder of the association, who advised DeJohnette to move to New York, which brought him into the company of such modern-jazz luminaries as the saxophonist Joe Henderson and the pianist McCoy Tyner. His career then took off with the formation of Lloyd’s genre-bending jazz-rock quartet, and reached an even bigger and younger cross-genre audience with Davis’s dramatic and austerely invigorating groups of the early 70s. But in between had come a 1968 European tour with Evans’s trio, which included a Montreux jazz festival performance that won a Grammy in its recorded version – notably aided by the young DeJohnette’s willingness to push even the most revered of jazz elders beyond their comfort zones. That European trip also led the drummer to Ronnie Scott’s Old Place, a jamming haunt for exploratory London musicians through which DeJohnette met the saxophonist John Surman, and formed a long-running creative partnership with him. Touring in Europe in 1972, DeJohnette met Manfred Eicher, the founder of ECM Records, and an innovator who had long foreseen how global musical developments in jazz were moving. He began a long association with the label – most significantly through a renewal of his relationship with Jarrett. With Jarrett and the bassist Gary Peacock, he was a cornerstone of the long-running Standards Trio, one of the great small groups in jazz history. Through ECM, he also fruitfully recorded with the guitarist John Abercrombie and the bassist Dave Holland – forming the superb Gateway trio with them in 1976 – and with Pat Metheny, the bassist Charlie Haden, and the saxophonists Dewey Redman and Michael Brecker on Metheny’s double album 80/81. Between 1979 and 1984, DeJohnette recorded a bold and personal sequence of ECM albums, Special Edition, Tin Can Alley and Album Album, featuring such powerful saxophonists as David Murray, Arthur Blythe and Chico Freeman, and revealing his own powers as a composer. In the 90s, he formed improv-oriented ensembles that included the keyboardist Michael Cain, and in the early 2000s explored contemplative and meditational music through the New Age projects Music in the Key of OM (2005) and Peace Time (2006). Two significant ventures of DeJohnette’s later years were his rough-hewn but spirited live reunion with his old Chicago bandmates Mitchell, Threadgill and Abrams, on Made in Chicago (2014), and the quartet set entitled Hudson (2017), with the guitarist John Scofield, keyboardist John Medeski and bassist Larry Grenadier, all of them residents of the Hudson Valley in New York State. It was no cosy sentimental journey despite its covers of popular hits, however, but a full-blooded stretch for the formidable jazz talents of all of them. A Native American chant figured in the repertoire, a reference to Seminole and Crow connections in DeJohnette’s ancestry. In 2024, a previously unreleased 1966 recording – Forces of Nature: Live at Slugs’ – emerged as a captivating indication of what DeJohnette’s impact on the jazz scene of his early years must have sounded like, in an enthralling encounter at the famous New York club, with Henderson on saxophone, Tyner on piano, and Henry Grimes on bass. DeJohnette is survived by his second wife, Lydia (nee Herman), whom he married in 1968, and their daughters, Farah and Minya. • Jack DeJohnette, drummer, pianist and composer, born 9 August 1942; died 26 October 2025",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/05/jack-dejohnette-obituary,Music,2025-11-05T20:52:57Z,2
music/2025/nov/04/donna-jean-godchaux-grateful-dead-tribute,Donna Jean Godchaux supplied steel and soul to the Grateful Dead in their prime,"By her own admission, Donna Jean Godchaux was not a fan of the Grateful Dead when she arrived in California – then Donna Jean Thatcher – in 1970. Already a music industry veteran at 23, she had spent five years as a member of Southern Comfort, a group of singers regularly employed as backing vocalists at the renowned Fame studios in her native Alabama. But she was rigidly unimpressed with her San Francisco friends’ undying devotion to Jerry Garcia and co. She hated the band’s name and loudly opined that the only reason people liked them was because they were invariably out of their minds on drugs when they went to see them live. In fact, she could prove she was right: she offered to attend a Dead show sober, certain she would hate it. It proved a fateful decision. By the end of the Dead’s set at the Winterland Ballroom, Thatcher – ostensibly retired from music – had announced: “If I sing again, it will be with this band”. Through attending other Dead shows she met a local pianist named Keith Godchaux, whom she subsequently married, and after meeting Garcia and angling for him to give her new husband a job, she found herself hired as well. It says something about the Grateful Dead’s unique position in American rock that Godchaux’s eight-year tenure with the band came to define her. It wasn’t as if her CV were lacking before she joined. Fame Studios was notoriously spotty when it came to crediting backing vocalists, so no complete record of her performances there exists, but she sang on Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds and In the Ghetto; Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman, and Warm and Tender Love; and with Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding and Dionne Warwick among others. Her timing in joining the Dead was fortuitous: their sound had taken a turn for the rootsy with 1970’s Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty – two key texts in the development of what would come to be called Americana – but the band’s usual source of traditionally soulful vocals, the blues-influenced keyboard player Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, was ailing, stricken by the alcoholism that hastened his death in 1973. Steeped in a different musical tradition to the rest of the band, Godchaux’s voice swiftly became part of their sound, as evidenced by her contributions to guitarist Bob Weir’s solo debut Ace – a Dead album in all but name – and Europe ’72, the triple-vinyl live set that documented the band’s visit to the continent in the spring of that year, and a strong contender for the title of greatest Grateful Dead album of all. But Godchaux’s apparently seamless integration into the band wasn’t quite as straightforward as it looked. She was a studio singer rather than a live vocalist, and the nightly high-wire act of the Grateful Dead’s live shows was quite the baptism by fire. Their three-hour-plus gigs were performed without a setlist, with members either calling for songs on stage in the style of jazz musicians at a jam session, or else by steering improvised passages towards the next track on the spot. In addition, it was a high-wire act that, in the early 70s at least, was often performed on acid. On one notable occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSD, unaware that the band’s supply – which had been weakening in strength as the tour progressed – had been replenished with fresh, undiluted provisions. In her account, she spent most of the show lying prone under her husband’s piano, but somehow still made it to the microphone in time to sing. Furthermore, while there were certainly some formidable women within the Dead’s inner circle – including Garcia’s partner Carolyn Adams, audio engineer and producer Betty Cantor-Jackson, and drummer Bill Kreutzmann’s wife Susila, who more or less singlehandedly started the band’s merchandising empire – its core was exclusively male and, as their biographer Dennis McNally tactfully put it, “not a bastion of feminist liberation”. But Godchaux, the only female member of the Grateful Dead during their 30-year history, was clearly made of stern stuff. She seldom took a lead vocal but demurred at the label “backing vocalist”, preferring the term “ensemble singing” – which certainly fits the sound of Godchaux and her band members belting out the choruses of Playing the Band or Eyes of the World en masse. Still, she proved a controversial figure. The culture of fans obsessively taping Grateful Dead shows meant that mistakes as well as transcendent moments were captured for posterity, and the mistakes often involved re-creating complex vocal harmonies on stage. But it seemed hugely unfair that Godchaux’s voice was singled out for criticism given how pitchy the other members could sound. And Godchaux was often magnificent in concert, as the belatedly released live albums One from the Vault or The Closing of Winterland proved. In the studio, her voice was unimpeachable. Hear the depth her harmonies bring to Row Jimmy and Stella Blue, two impossibly beautiful ballads from 1973’s Wake of the Flood, the raw soulfulness of her voice on 1975’s The Music Never Stopped or her fantastic contributions to 1977’s slick Terrapin Station. And if you want to venture away from the Grateful Dead per se, her vocals on Palm Sunday and the brief Down Home from the Jerry Garcia Band’s 1978 album Cats Under the Stars are incredible. Keith and Donna Godchaux both left the Grateful Dead after 1978’s patchy Shakedown Street, an album that sounded distinctly coked-out. The couple moved to Alabama to deal with Keith’s worsening drug problem, and he had apparently conquered his addictions when he was killed in a car crash in 1980. Donna Jean married bass player David MacKay in 1981, becoming Donna Jean Thatcher Godchaux-Mackay, and formed a succession of other bands, but she never really left the Grateful Dead behind. She still performed their songs. Her version of Crazy Fingers is a highlight of the 2014 album she recorded with Jeff Matson, and Matson is a member of the Grateful Dead tribute band the Zen Tricksters, with whom Godchaux also recorded an album. She also happily sat in on stage with the Dark Star Orchestra, a band dedicated to recreating classic Dead shows live, became involved with the unending stream of archival Grateful Dead releases, and occasionally appeared on stage with various former band members. Once a controversial addition, her role in the band seemed to be burnished by the passing of time. Deadheads can argue for hours about which of their lineups was the best, but the Godchaux-bolstered 70s version is always in strong contention. It was something that the band’s official statement about her death seemed to touch on: “Her contributions will forever remain part of the tapestry that continues to be woven.”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/04/donna-jean-godchaux-grateful-dead-tribute,Music,2025-11-04T17:53:48Z,2
culture/2025/oct/28/jon-stewart-trump-third-term-white-house-demolition,Jon Stewart on Trump’s taunts of an illegal third term: ‘We know he’s thought about it’,"Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s taunts about an illegal third presidential term and his demolition of the East Wing of the White House. Jon Stewart From his Monday night post on the Daily Show, Jon Stewart assessed the threat of Trump attempting to run for a third term as president, which is illegal under the 22nd amendment to the constitution. Asked by reporters for his thoughts on comments by Steve Bannon that he had a plan for such a campaign, Trump answered: “I would love to do it ... I have my best numbers ever.” He also claimed, however: “I haven’t really thought about it.” “That’s the tell for whenever he’s asked about something that he is definitely going to do that is dubious legally, ethically or morally,” Stewart noted. “He says he hasn’t thought about it. But of course we know he’s thought about it because he already has the merch,” he added, pointing to “Trump 2028” hats that Trump has displayed in the Oval Office. “What’s interesting about Trump is he’s actually worked through the various scenarios of running for a third term that he has not thought about,” said Stewart, pointing to Trump’s further comments that “I think the people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute.” “Too cute? No, that’s why you don’t go to Build-a-Bear as an adult,” Stewart replied. “Running as the vice-president to skirt the 22nd amendment isn’t cute. But he’s the kinda guy who’s like ‘I respect Americans too much to play games. If I’m going to run again, I’m going to rip off the constitution’s head and shit down its neck.’ “Indications are very clear he’s gonna do it,” he continued, “because you don’t move into a house, knock down a wing and build a 90,000-sq-ft ballroom for the next guy. “Trump’s not a house-flipper,” he added. “He’s not Ellen. He’s in it for the long haul.” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel returned from a weeklong family trip to Ireland with renewed perspective on his home country. “In case you’re wondering what people in other countries think about what’s going on here in our country, I’ll tell you: they’re worried about us,” he said. “They’re very worried. They’re worried about us in the same way you worry about a nephew who you maybe haven’t seen for a few years and he shows up at Thanksgiving missing all of his front teeth? That kind of worry.” People in Ireland, Kimmel reported, had a lot of questions for him about Trump, including: “Why is he knocking down part of the White House?” “I don’t know. Nobody knows,” he answered. “I don’t think he even knows. “Back here at home, the unrest continues to rage out of control. Antifa terrorists are destroying government – oh wait, that’s the White House,” Kimmel joked over a photo of the demolished East Wing. “That’s what Trump did on purpose, without permission, to the White House. I told you we should’ve made him put down a security deposit!” Nevertheless, Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, defended the move on NBC News: “I think this was a judgment call by the president. The president is a master builder. I don’t know, I assume that maybe parts of the East Wing, there could’ve been asbestos, there could’ve been mold. “There could’ve been some old Chinese food, could’ve been ghosts! We don’t know,” Kimmel joked. “All we know is that the only solution was to completely smash the whole place down. I wish the master builder would master-build in private like the rest of us do.” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also touched on the Trump 2028 hats seen on his desk during meetings with congressional Democrats. “It’s so weird to make a hat for a thing that can’t happen,” said Meyers. “Wearing a Trump 2028 hat is like wearing a hat that says Super Bowl champion New York Jets.” “So Trump put some hats on the desk during a meeting with Democrats,” he continued, “and the Democrats in attendance definitely thought it was weird.” As the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told CNN: “it was the strangest thing ever.” “Come on, the strangest thing ever? Don’t you live Brooklyn?” Meyers laughed. “If someone Rollerbladed into a Brooklyn deli wearing a full mermaid costume, the only thing anyone would say is ‘the usual, Jeff?’ “It’s not even the strangest thing Trump has done,” he continued. “Not long before that meeting, he wandered on to the roof of the White House. “Think about how insane this is: this was supposed to be a meeting about keeping the government open, making sure troops get paid and families get nutrition assistance and air traffic controllers can do their jobs,” Meyers added. “And instead the president’s main interest was trolling. “Trump can’t help himself,” he concluded. “The Maga movement cares more about trolling libs than making government function, which is why he keeps going on about this unconstitutional third term.” Stephen Colbert “It was a beautiful day here in America because Donald Trump was out of the country,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. To start the week, Trump was on a “field trip” to Asia, where “he’s going to tear down the Great Wall and put up a ballroom,” Colbert quipped. The trip includes stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, where Trump danced to a marching band in a way that Colbert could only describe as “shuffling and swinging his wrists like a low-battery Chuck E Cheese robot”. In Japan, the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, reportedly planned to gift Trump a gold golf ball. “It is so sad to see how easy it is to butter up the president of the United States,” Colbert remarked. “OK quick, Trump’s visiting, what are we going to get him this time? Gold burger? Gold TV? Have we tried spray-painting a woman gold?” Colbert also touched on the fourth week of the ongoing government shutdown. “The longer it goes, the more used to having no government we get and then the less likely it is to ever end,” he said. The shutdown is now restricting military pay. But on Friday, an anonymous donor – later identified as Timothy Mellon – gifted $130m to pay troops during the shutdown. “I know that sounds nice, I get it, but I don’t like the idea of the armed forces having a private sponsor,” Colbert said. “I don’t want our next invasion to be code-named ‘Operation Chili’s New El Diablo Triple Dipper Rib Tips: Can You Stand the Heat?’”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/28/jon-stewart-trump-third-term-white-house-demolition,Culture,2025-10-28T14:13:13Z,2
culture/2025/oct/17/jimmy-kimmel-republicans-trump,Jimmy Kimmel on the Republicans: ‘So much greed and hypocrisy and duplicity’,"Late-night hosts spoke about Donald Trump’s attempts to transform the White House and how he was “cashing in bigly” on being president. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host spoke about Trump’s “goon squad” indicting his former national security adviser John Bolton while the president was still “brazenly lying about the economy”. This week Trump also met with Vladimir Putin, something he bragged about on social media before claiming that he is the only president to have ended a war. “All the other wars ended mysteriously by themselves,” Kimmel said. Trump also “still has his eye on the ballroom” hosting an event for investors willing to help fund a renovation. Kimmel named a number of tech companies, including Meta and Google, who all “lined up to eat beef stroganoff and kiss his ass”. He said it was like “a demented version of Cinderella where the pumpkin is in charge”. Trump has still been “cashing in bigly” on being president with his family earning $1bn in crypto alone over the last year. He has also continued to sell watches via adverts mainly shown on Fox News. “Try to imagine Lincoln in front of a flag selling top hats,” he said, before adding: “Trump doesn’t even wear a watch!” Kimmel said there is “so much greed and hypocrisy and duplicity” in the party with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, still blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. Kimmel again noted that it was all a distraction from the Epstein files. This Saturday will see nationwide protests against Trump’s authoritarian rule, and even though they are aiming to be peaceful, Kimmel said that on Fox they will be painted as “violent, vicious Antifa riots”. The right has already been calling them “Hate America” rallies and Kimmel joked that the January 6 insurrection was only a “patriotic walking tour”. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Trump’s “Cinderella ballroom” and the dinner attended by investors. He called it a “big dumb vanity project”. Trump also wants a triumphal arch in the capital and has taken credit for designing it. “We’ve had them for thousands of years,” Colbert scoffed. Republicans have also been sharing videos depicting Chicago as a war zone using footage from other states. “I can’t believe that’s what Chicago looks like now because it doesn’t,” he said. Colbert joked that if you wanted to reveal the horrors in the city, “just show a deep dish pizza”. This week has also seen leaked chats from the Young Republicans group which have unearthed “deeply disturbing texts” including support for Hitler. When Mike Johnson was asked about it, he denied it reflected the party’s values. Colbert joked that if Johnson had a time machine, “would he use it to go back and kiss baby Hitler?”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/17/jimmy-kimmel-republicans-trump,Culture,2025-10-17T15:00:21Z,2
culture/2025/oct/17/laurence-fox-social-media-libel-claim-goes-to-retrial-after-court-of-appeal-ruling,Laurence Fox’s libel claim over racism accusations to go to retrial,"Laurence Fox’s libel claim after he was called a racist on social media will go to a retrial, the court of appeal has ruled. The former actor was successfully sued by Simon Blake, who is now the chief executive of Stonewall, and the drag artist Crystal over a row on the social media platform Twitter, now called X. Fox, 47, called Blake and the former RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant, whose real name is Colin Seymour, “paedophiles” in an exchange about a decision by Sainsbury’s to mark Black History Month in October 2020. Fox called for a boycott of the supermarket and was called “a racist” by the men, as well as by the broadcaster Nicola Thorp, before he responded with the “paedophile” tweets which led to the initial libel claims. In two judgments in 2024, Mrs Justice Collins Rice ruled in favour of Blake and Seymour, and said Fox should pay them £90,000 each in damages. The judge dismissed Fox’s counter-claims against them and Thorp for libel over tweets accusing him of racism. Fox challenged this decision at the court of appeal in London, where his lawyers described the previous judge’s decision as “plainly wrong”. In a decision on Friday, Lord Justice Dingemans, Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing and Lord Justice Warby ruled in Fox’s favour on his counter-claims and the level of damages. Warby said the tweets describing Fox as a racist caused serious harm to his reputation and his libel claim should be reconsidered at a retrial. He also reduced the amount of damages Fox was ordered to pay to Blake and Seymour to £45,000, with Dingemans describing the previous sums as “manifestly excessive”. The court of appeal judges dismissed Fox’s attempt to overturn the finding that he had libelled Blake and Seymour. After the decision, Fox complained about being “cancelled”, adding: “We don’t want to live in a country where conversations and careers are destroyed and shut down by that most appalling of slurs.” In a video posted on X, he said: “I hope now, in fact I know now, that people will think twice before making that horrible allegation again. “I was cancelled entirely from the job I love, and I still love and I hope to do again, overnight, so I am so grateful for this outcome and I hope it plays a part in putting free speech exactly back where it belongs, at the cornerstone of any free society.”",culture,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/17/laurence-fox-social-media-libel-claim-goes-to-retrial-after-court-of-appeal-ruling,Culture,2025-10-17T11:55:55Z,2
artanddesign/2025/oct/15/glorified-sheds-sleek-sci-fi-palaces-architecture-football-stadiums-home-ground,From glorified sheds to sleek sci-fi palaces: how architecture put the zing into football grounds ,"Bill Shankly, a man so beloved by Liverpool that there is now a hotel in the city named after him, once famously observed: “Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.” Inevitably, Shankly pops up in Home Ground, a punchy new exhibition on the architecture and social culture of football stadiums. The legendary manager is pictured savouring the acclaim of an adoring crowd, part of a tableau on the farewell to the Kop prior to its metamorphosis from churning tribal terrace into a more sedate, all-seater stand. Marinaded in the romance and obsessiveness of the beautiful game, Liverpool is a serendipitous setting for a dive into the history and destiny of football grounds. Everton have just migrated to a super sleek new home, the 52,000 capacity Hill Dickinson Stadium on the Mersey waterfront, neatly encapsulating the distance football and its venues have travelled from rain-lashed terraces, flat caps and leaden balls, to a high-end, multi-sensory experience, with those who can afford it cosseted in private boxes and plied with fine dining, not unlike a visit to the opera. Illustrated by a rich assortment of drawings, models, photographs and other ephemera, the exhibition’s chronological sweep opens with a 1906 plan of Anfield by Scottish architect Archibald Leitch. The towering terrace of 132 steps at the home end became known as the Kop, after the bloody hilltop battle of Spion Kop during the Boer war. Drawing on his early experience of designing factories and warehouses, Leitch went on to become the imperator of early football grounds. With daunting efficiency, he notched up more than 20 across the UK, including Stamford Bridge (Chelsea), Highbury (Arsenal) and Ibrox (Glasgow Rangers). Over a 29-year period he also designed Goodison Park, home of Liverpool’s great rivals Everton. Still used by its women’s team, it was the first ground in Britain to have seats and terracing on all four sides. England may have invented and formalised the game, but in the matter of stadium design, it was its European neighbours who really ran with the ball. In Florence, Fiorentina employed the renowned modernist Pier Luigi Nervi to devise a graceful exercise in reinforced concrete that brilliantly exploited the material’s potential to be shaped and sculpted. In Rotterdam, Feyenoord’s stadium of 1937 embodied the functionalist ideals of the Dutch Nieuwe Bouwen (New Building) movement, with a lightweight, skeletal steel frame used to suspend the upper tier above the lower, offering an unimpeded view of the pitch, revolutionary for its time. In a nice touch, the show’s thematic sections are denoted by custom designed football scarves in the zinging emerald green of grass under floodlights. In the part dedicated to Italia 90, graphic designer Alberto Burri’s definitive World Cup poster features a football pitch in Rome’s Colosseum, the ur-stadium and theoretical point of origin for all modern football grounds. Italy went large on its hosting duties, spending billions upgrading existing stadiums and constructing new ones, including a sunken bowl in Bari by the Genoese hi-tech architect Renzo Piano with structural ribs resembling a whale’s carcass. Dominating proceedings like a giant wedding cake is a model of the San Siro in Milan. For Italia 90, an entirely new structure was built over the original 1926 stadium, incorporating red steel roof trusses supported by corkscrew-shaped circulation towers. Memorably, when crowds surge down the corkscrews, the towers appear to be spiralling, in a bizarre optical illusion. Though it remains the base of AC Milan and rivals Inter, after years of protracted wrangling, its days look to be numbered. There are some surprising heirs to Archie Leitch. Though you might not think it, Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are huge football aficionados with their firm producing some of the most radically inventive contemporary stadium designs. Fabricated from nearly 3,000 inflatable foil cushions impregnated with LED lighting, Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena can instantly change the colour of its skin, like a colossal, glowing chameleon. And in Braga, in northern Portugal, Eduardo Souto de Moura set a stadium in a disused limestone quarry, a natural amphitheatre where a wayward shot on goal will rebound off a cliff face. “Spaceship” is an overused epithet, but football stadiums do have an otherworldly aura, as modern colossi looming above huddled neighbourhoods, evocative of Philip Larkin’s “ships up streets”. Yet size isn’t necessarily everything. In Galashiels in Scotland, Gala Fairydean’s bijoux stand for 750 supporters resembles a piece of concrete origami, designed by Peter Womersley in 1965. A pivotal moment was legislation for the development of all-seater grounds following the catastrophe of Hillsborough, its impact still resonating after nearly four decades. Before Hillsborough, 56 people died in the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire, in which the dilapidated main stand became an inferno within 270 seconds. Such disasters marked a hideous low point in British football history, showing how supporters were seen in a demeaning and dehumanised light by the authorities and how ageing structures had become rickety death traps. Unimaginably removed from the era of seething crowds on acres of terraces, the future of football stadiums lies in being increasingly sustainable and flexible. After the retractable roof comes the retractable pitch, as at Tottenham Hotspur’s new ground by arena design specialists Populous, which can accommodate everything from concerts to American football. Currently managed by former bad boy Robbie Savage, Forest Green Rovers may be minnows playing in the English league’s fifth tier, but have been described by Fifa as “the greenest team in the world”, demonstrating that a club can prioritise sustainability and still achieve success. Its proposal to build the world’s first all-timber stadium, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, will form the centrepiece of a new ecology park for the local community. The growth of the women’s game is also destined to shape the stadiums of the future. American club Kansas City Current are the first to play in a purpose-built venue for women’s professional soccer, incorporating subtle design changes such as modified seating and sight-lines, all calculated to appeal to a more family-oriented fanbase. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner once said: “A bicycle shed is a building; Lincoln Cathedral is a piece of architecture.” For much of their history, football stadiums used to be more bike shed than cathedral but their time has now spectacularly come.

stage/2025/oct/03/romeo-a-juliet-review-sherman-theatre-cardiff,Romeo a Juliet review – star-crossed lovers divided by language,"‘Speakest thou from the heart?” Or rather: “Ai dyna iaith dy galon?” In Theatr Cymru’s bilingual tragedy, alternating between Shakespeare’s English and JT Jones’s Welsh translation, the uttering of any word acquires a particular salience. Steffan Donnelly’s finely detailed production casts the Montagues as Welsh speakers and the Capulets as not. It’s a neat dramatic conceit that in its most successful moments finds striking new fissions within the familiar stage traffic. Isabella Colby Browne’s Juliet is often playfully petulant, complemented by Steffan Cennydd’s easy, prepossessing swagger as Romeo. Eiry Thomas’s commanding Ffrier Lorens makes an impression and Llinor ap Gwynedd’s excellent turn as the Nyrs, mostly English-speaking but with a broad Welsh accent, is imbued with a new dramatic complexity within the bilingual conceit. After Capulet strikes the Nyrs, calling her a “mumbling fool” for having uttered a Welsh sentence, all kinds of violent prejudices are bracingly exposed in a single, pithy sentence. Similarly, in the seclusion of her cell, the Ffrier and Romeo privately confer in Welsh, but respond to intrusive knocks from the outside world in English. All of this is evocatively staged on Elin Steele’s set of staircases and alcoves, which uses water to great effect – cleansing while also portending catastrophe. While the ambitious concept opens the possibility of exploring linguistic identity, intertwined with familial and class allegiances, its impact feels nebulous when the deployment of different languages is not underpinned by dramatic logic and instead seems arbitrary. The experience can feel discordant and the scenes performed mostly in one language or the other (and one particularly elegiac sequence with no words at all) are more compelling. Staged in association with the Globe, the production’s tour will end on the bank of the Thames where perhaps such conceptual dissonances will be less of an issue to audiences unfamiliar with the Welsh language. As a production, it clearly speaks from the calon. But as well as that heart, you yearn for more logic. • At Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 3 October.

education/article/2024/jul/04/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation-education-department,Trump and Project 2025 are attacking the Department of Education. How might they reshape US schools?,"Donald Trump wants to shut down the US Department of Education, saying at recent rallies that it should be disbanded to “move everything back to the states where it belongs”. The idea of dismantling the education department has become increasingly mainstream, though it’s nearly as old as the department itself, which was created by Congress as a cabinet-level agency in 1979. Trump made similar promises on the 2016 campaign trail to either cut or hobble the department. Eliminating it would require Congress to act, which could be an impossible feat, though several of Trump and his allies’ policy goals on education could be accomplished through presidential actions. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing manifesto for a potential incoming Trump administration, lays out how dismantling the federal education department would work, leaving behind, if anything, a husk focused solely as a “statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states”, writes Lindsey Burke, the author of the education chapter and leader of Heritage’s education policy center. The department’s elimination is one of many goals contained in the extensive conservative playbook that will inform a second Trump term. Project 2025 calls for privatizing education and driving out any programs related to LGBTQ+ youth or diversity. “This playbook actually goes into detail that we’ve never seen before,” said Weadé James, senior director for K-12 policy at the Center for American Progress. It would have profound implications on civil rights, school funding and students’ progress – not to mention on the fate of public schools, she said. “The striking part about all of this, too, is the Department of Education is actually the smallest of any cabinet-level agency. There are only a little over 4,000 employees within the department,” James said. “So we need to be talking about investing in the department, expanding the capacity of the department to do the work that it is designed to do.” Burke, the Heritage author , declined a request for an interview. In a statement, the Heritage Foundation said that while it seeks to offer recommendations to the “next conservative president”, it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign”. And while Trump’s campaign has tried to distance the candidate from Project 2025, saying he has his own agenda to carry out, the former president and the project are aligned on much of their education plans. During a speech to a “faith and freedom” conference this week, Trump railed against education rankings and spending, saying the US performs poorly despite money spent on students. Some states could do better without federal intervention, he said. “We’ll cut our budget in half and not everybody’s going to be great,” he said. “I mean, [California governor] Gavin Newsom will not do a good job with education, so I don’t expect that out of him. And I don’t expect it out of certain other people … But many of the states, I would say 40 of the 50 states will do much better. And I’ll bet you 30 of the states will be phenomenal.” Trump tells voters on his campaign site a few ways he would manage education: Cut federal funding for schools that are “pushing critical race theory or gender ideology on our children” and open civil rights investigations into them for race-based discrimination. End access for trans youth to sports. Create a body that will certify teachers who “embrace patriotic values”. Reward districts that get rid of teacher tenure. Adopt a parents’ bill of rights. Implement direct elections of school principals by parents. School funding fundamentally changed Education is primarily funded and overseen by state and local authorities in the US, but the federal government funds some elements of education and sets certain policies, which are then implemented locally. As it stands now, schools receive federal grants targeted toward specific purposes, like aiding low-income students or students with disabilities. States implement these programs, often hiring people to ensure they comply with federal requirements. Project 2025 posits various ways to put states in control of programs the federal government now funds and manages. Instead of directing how funds should be used, it generally says states should be given money with no strings attached to spend on “any lawful education purpose under state law”. These “block grants” often receive pushback. And when states receive set amounts rather than funds based on specific needs, they can often fall short. The project proposes phasing out one major program, Title I, over a 10-year period. The $18bn funding source supports low-income students. Instead, the project says states “should assume decision-making control over how to provide a quality education to children from low-income families”. “Phasing that out is going to be very detrimental to that population of students who are already vulnerable for many reasons,” James said. The Heritage Foundation also wants to eliminate Head Start, a program that funds early childhood education for low-income families, because it is “fraught with scandal and abuse”, according to a chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services. The Center for American Progress says in a new report that eliminating Head Start would reduce access and increase costs for childcare, hurting economic stability. Beyond these major funding changes, the project – and Trump – both want to see expansions of school choice, like voucher programs that allow students to use money that would otherwise fund their seats at public schools to attend a private ones. Trump has said that he supports universal school choice, or the ability of any student to use taxpayer funds to attend whatever school they want. Trump also has a video on his campaign site dedicated to how he would help home-schooling families. “What about those students who are going to remain in those public schools?” James said. “We need to change our rhetoric to really focus on investment in public schools, as opposed to vouchers that take away from public schools.” The project cites Arizona’s expansion of vouchers to all students as a model, though the program there has been the subject of much scrutiny, including recently over costs. LGBTQ+ and diversity issues attacked Anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-diversity policies are sprinkled throughout the education recommendations in Project 2025 and in Trump’s platform. The project also supports passing a parents’ bill of rights to give parents more access to classroom materials. The project proposes ridding education programs of any “gender ideology and critical race theory”, like a “non-binary” category in data collection or the ability of trans youth to participate in sports aligned with their gender. It also calls for parental approval for the use of names or pronouns other than those on birth certificates. And it wants to gut protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Project 2025 suggests the federal government put anti-LGBTQ+ policies in place in the schools it oversees as a way to set an example to state and local leaders. As examples of what the project considers “critical race theory” that should be abolished, it mentions “mandatory affinity groups”, training programs for teachers that require them to “confess their privilege” or assignments in which “students must defend the false idea that America is systemically racist”. These activities are “actively disrupting the values that hold communities together such as equality under the law and colorblindness”. The project also wants what remains of the Department of Education to gather data and report on programs or grants that spread “DEI/CRT/gender ideology”, how “family structure” affects student achievement, how pandemic aid funds were spent and how much money goes directly into the classroom from federal grant programs. Trump has made it a regular part of his rallies to harp on diversity and LGBTQ+ issues in schools, too. At the faith conference, he vowed to sign an executive order on day one that would cut federal funding for “any school pushing critical race theory, transgender, insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on to the lives of our children”.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/jul/04/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation-education-department,Education,2024-07-04T11:00:37Z,12
education/2025/oct/06/pro-palestine-students-urged-to-mind-terror-laws-before-7-october-protests,UK students urged to mind terror laws before 7 October pro-Palestine protests,"University leaders have cautioned students planning to take part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations to coincide with the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, warning them that “expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence”. Up to 10 events – variously described as vigils, rallies and debates – are thought to have been planned on or near campuses on Tuesday, including an “inter-university” march in London, involving students and staff from several London institutions. It will be the second anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead, many more injured or kidnapped and sparked the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 65,000 people. Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-chancellors and acts as the voice of the sector, wrote to members last week after the attack on Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, warning that the anniversary was a “potential flashpoint” and urging members to “review security arrangements”. Vivienne Stern, the UUK’s chief executive, said: “While universities must be places where contentious views can be expressed, and while universities have a legal duty to uphold free speech, we urge students and staff participating in protests to remember that 7 October is the anniversary of an atrocious attack on innocent people, and that expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence.” Details of the London march are posted on Instagram under the banner headline: “Inter-university march. Two years of genocide and our institutions remain complicit.” It calls for a walkout of classes at 2pm, with the route taking in King’s College London (KCL), the London School of Economics, University College London and finishing at SOAS. Other 7 October events have been advertised at the University of Sheffield, where the Revolutionary Communist party is staging a “rally for Palestine”, and Strathclyde University, where the Palestine Solidarity Society is staging a “Protest 4 Palestine”, while KCL Students for Justice for Palestine has an evening of debate and discussion called “Why it didn’t start on October 7th”. Stern said there has been a “deeply concerning” rise in antisemitic incidents in the last two years and the “UUK has worked closely with university leaders to tackle this”. She urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents. “We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,” she added. Louis Danker, the president of the Union of Jewish Students, said: “We respect the right to protest and the importance of free speech within the law. There are 365 days in the year and on one of them – 7 October – Jewish students seek the space to mourn their loved ones murdered in southern Israel. “Moreover, marking ‘two years of resistance’ on 7 October echoes the explicit justification and glorification of the Hamas terrorist attacks on campus witnessed over the last two years. “No Jewish student should have to stand by as others glorify a day that marks such loss for our community. We have written to vice-chancellors and university leaders to remind them of their obligation to stand against the glorification of terror.” On Monday evening Keir Starmer urged students not to take part in what he called “un-British” protests. Writing in the Times, the prime minister said: “Let me just spell that out for a moment: people on our streets calling for the murder of Jewish people they have never even met, for something they are not responsible for. A total loss of empathy and humanity not in some faraway land but right here in the heart of our country. “And today, on the anniversary of the atrocities of 7 October, students are once again planning protests. This is not who we are as a country. It’s un-British to have so little respect for others. And that’s before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.” On Saturday police arrested almost 500 people in London at what organisers hoped would be the biggest demonstration so far against a ban on the proscribed organisation Palestine Action. The demonstration went ahead despite Starmer calling on protesters to call it off to “respect the grief of British Jews”, while Jewish leaders described the action as “phenomenally tone deaf” after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “The horrific tragedy in Manchester makes clear now more than ever that there is absolutely no place for antisemitic abuse or harassment, hate speech or violence in our society. “I would urge those planning to protest to show decency and humanity when deciding whether to do so, given the immense pain many people in the Jewish community will be feeling on 7 October. “I remain steadfast in my support for university vice-chancellors in tackling the scourge of antisemitic abuse and harassment on campuses, and I have written to them in support of their efforts.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/06/pro-palestine-students-urged-to-mind-terror-laws-before-7-october-protests,Education,2025-10-06T22:32:55Z,5
education/2025/oct/30/jane-plastow-obituary,Jane Plastow obituary,"Jane Plastow, who has died of cancer aged 66, was an academic and theatre-maker based at the University of Leeds who made invaluable contributions to the fields of community-based theatre, African studies and global development. Jane led the Centre for African Studies at Leeds from 2004 to 2014, overseeing the innovative theatre and global development MA. In 2006 she was made professor of African theatre, with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka attending her inaugural lecture. A pivotal point in Jane’s career came in the 1990s with her long-term projects with Eritrean artists and educators in the aftermath of the war of independence. Most recently, Jane had a longstanding collaboration with We Are Walukuba, a community group in Jinja, Uganda. Over a decade, Jane and collaborators challenged the dominant short-term and message-based conventions of theatre for development by co-creating new approaches to challenge existing social issues. These long-term dialogical forms of artistic engagement promoted grassroots knowledge and discussion between community members and wider stakeholders. Her experience led to the publication of her two-volume A History of East African Theatre (2020, 2021), followed by Community-Based Arts, Research and Activism in Uganda: We Are Walukuba (2025), and her forthcoming monograph Somali Musical Theatre (2026). Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, she was the daughter of Mary (nee Luckett), a legal secretary, and Gerald Plastow, who worked in local government. After attending Tunbridge Wells Girls’ grammar school, Jane completed a BA in English at the University of Manchester in 1981. She then travelled to Africa for the first time, undertaking a teaching post in the Gambia. This job would mark the beginning of a 44-year collaborative relationship with African artists, activists and educators traversing many countries including Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Somaliland, Djibouti and Zimbabwe. After her time in the Gambia, Jane became a lecturer at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, for three years. She then completed an MPhil and a PhD at Manchester, before moving to the Ulster University at Coleraine in 1991 to lecture in theatre studies, and then to Leeds in 1994. Jane acted as PhD supervisor for many students, many of whom went on to hold senior positions at leading African universities. In her years after her cancer diagnosis, Jane became interested in growing authoritarianism in the UK when her son, Will, was arrested for pro-Palestinian activism. Her uncompleted final book, provisionally titled Keir Starmer’s Political Prisoners, consisted of interviews with British political prisoners, and highlighted the increasingly severe state crackdown on dissent in the UK. Jane was a collaborator who truly believed, inhabited and realised the political power of the arts. She had an unrelenting and unstoppable energy and an enormous sense of fun. She is survived by Will, her brother, John, and sisters Beverley and Caroline.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/30/jane-plastow-obituary,Education,2025-10-30T19:41:38Z,4
education/2025/sep/13/president-elect-to-face-disciplinary-proceedings-for-charlie-kirk-remarks-oxford-union-says,President-elect of Oxford Union to face disciplinary proceedings for Charlie Kirk remarks,"The president-elect of the Oxford Union will face disciplinary proceedings for making “inappropriate remarks” celebrating the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, the union has announced on social media. George Abaraonye, a student at the University of Oxford who became president-elect of the debating society after a vote in June, posted several comments in a WhatsApp group appearing to celebrate what happened, according to the Telegraph. This included one saying: “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s fucking go.” Another message, purportedly sent from Abaraonye’s Instagram account, read: “Charlie Kirk got shot loool.” The Oxford Union said on Saturday that Abaraonye had suffered racial abuse and threats since his comments were revealed in the Telegraph on Thursday. In a statement posted on social media on Saturday, the union reiterated that it had already condemned the president-elect’s “inappropriate remarks”. The society added: “We emphasise that these are his personal views and not those of the Union, nor do they represent the values of our institution. “At the same time, we are deeply disturbed by and strongly condemn the racial abuse and threats that George has faced in response. No individual should ever be attacked because of the colour of their skin or the community they come from. Threats to his life are abhorrent. Such rhetoric has no place online, or anywhere in society.” The statement went on to defend the right to free speech and freedom of expression, but added that free speech “cannot and will not come at the expense of violence, intimidation, or hate”. “The Oxford Union does not possess executive powers to summarily dismiss a president-elect. However, the complaints filed against the president-elect have been forwarded for disciplinary proceedings and will be addressed with the utmost seriousness. “Our duty is to demonstrate to our members, the university community, alumni, and the wider public, that disagreement must be expressed through debate and dialogue, not through abuse or threats. That is the tradition we uphold, and it is the standard we will continue to set.” On Thursday, Abaraonye said he had “reacted impulsively” to the news of Kirk’s shooting, and that the comments were “quickly deleted” after news emerged of his death. “Those words did not reflect my values,” Abaraonye added. “Nobody deserves to be the victim of political violence … I extend my condolences to his family and loved ones. “At the same time, my reaction was shaped by the context of Mr Kirk’s own rhetoric – words that often dismissed or mocked the suffering of others. He described the deaths of American children from school shootings as an acceptable ‘cost’ of protecting gun rights. He justified the killing of civilians in Gaza, including women and children, by blaming them collectively for Hamas. He called for the retraction of the Civil Rights Act, and repeatedly spread harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ and trans communities. These were horrific and dehumanising statements.” Kirk and Abaraonye had met during a debate on toxic masculinity held by the Oxford Union in May, the Telegraph reported. Donald Trump, the US president, paid tribute to Kirk as a “martyr for truth and freedom” after the shooting. Valerie Amos, the master of University College, Oxford, said on Friday that no disciplinary action would be taken against Abaraonye by the college he attends. Amos said: “Though Mr Abaraonye’s comments are abhorrent, they do not contravene the college’s policies on free speech, or any other relevant policy. Therefore, no disciplinary action will be taken.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/president-elect-to-face-disciplinary-proceedings-for-charlie-kirk-remarks-oxford-union-says,Education,2025-09-13T15:58:05Z,4
education/2025/feb/20/african-history-students-compensation-masters-axed-university-of-chichester,African history students awarded compensation after master’s axed,"An independent adjudicator has ruled partly in favour of students who challenged the University of Chichester after their African history course was abruptly terminated in 2023. The university suspended recruitment to its research master’s (MRes) in the history of Africa and the African diaspora without warning, and made the course leader, Prof Hakim Adi, who is an academic and expert in African history, redundant. Thirteen students took legal action against the university after it terminated their programme while they were partway through their studies. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) for Higher Education found the complaint made by students against the university was partly justified, ruling that the students had a legitimate expectation to be taught by an expert under whom they had specifically enrolled to study. The OIA determined that the university advertised its programme based on the promise that students would be able to “learn directly” from Adi, whom the university described as the “only professor of the history of Africa and the African diaspora in Britain”. The university has been ordered to pay compensation to the affected students. Jacqueline McKenzie, a human rights partner at Leigh Day who represented the students, said: “The OIA’s ruling is a significant victory for the students who were left in academic limbo after their course was unjustly terminated. The decision acknowledges the fundamental principle that students should receive the education they were promised, taught by the experts they signed up to learn from.” Timi Okuwa, the CEO of the Black Equity Organisation, said: “We welcome the decision by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education, which has ruled partly in favour of the African and Caribbean students affected by the University of Chichester’s termination of the programme. This decision is a significant step in the fight for racial justice and educational fairness.” Adi had worked at the university for more than a decade and founded the MRes in 2017. The decision to curtail the course came amid a crippling financial crisis affecting higher education across the UK. It sparked outrage, with thousands of supporters signing a petition demanding the course and Adi be reinstated. The course was credited with paving the way for successive historians of African descent in the UK. Chichester was among several universities in England to implement cost-cutting measures. Critics argued that the cuts disproportionately targeted lecturers and courses dedicated to addressing racial disparities in higher education, raising concerns that Black scholarship in the UK was at serious risk of being wiped out. A university spokesperson said: “Like all universities, the University of Chichester periodically reviews its course portfolio in response to enrolment trends and financial pressures. The MRes in the history of Africa and the African diaspora regrettably closed to new applicants in 2023, but we are making every effort to work with continuing students so that they can complete their studies. We refute any suggestion of discrimination and note that the OIA claim was only partially upheld on the basis of procedural issues.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/feb/20/african-history-students-compensation-masters-axed-university-of-chichester,Education,2025-02-20T18:34:38Z,4
education/2025/feb/12/sacking-of-christian-school-worker-kristie-higgs-lgbtq-critical-posts-unlawful-court-of-appeal-rules,"Sacking of Christian school worker over posts about LGBTQ+ lessons unlawful, court rules","A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. “Because of those posts, I lost my job. Today, after nearly seven years, the court of appeal has finally put that right. Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Sean Jones KC, acting for Farmor’s, said in earlier written submissions that Higgs was not dismissed for manifesting her beliefs “but because the manner in which it was manifested could reasonably have caused and did cause others to think she was expressing homophobic or transphobic views”. He argued remitting the case was appropriate as “fuller reasons” for the decision were needed. In a 57-page ruling, Underhill said Higgs’s posts were not grossly offensive but a series of derogatory sneers. “I do not believe that dismissal was even arguably a proportionate sanction for the claimant’s conduct,” he added. A spokesperson for Stonewall said: “Today’s court of appeal ruling is a judgment on the proportionality of her dismissal, not an endorsement of the beliefs she expressed. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” The Press Association contributed to this report",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/feb/12/sacking-of-christian-school-worker-kristie-higgs-lgbtq-critical-posts-unlawful-court-of-appeal-rules,Education,2025-02-12T17:32:57Z,4
education/2024/oct/13/uk-university-cuts-threaten-to-wipe-out-black-scholarship-academics-say,"UK university cuts threaten to ‘wipe out’ black scholarship, academics say","Black scholarship in the UK risks being wiped out due to redundancies and course closures, leading academics have warned. Universities in England are engulfed in a financial crisis and have in response implemented a number of cost-cutting measures. But prominent academics and students are raising the alarm that these cuts are falling on lecturers and courses that played a leading role in addressing racial disparities in higher education. The University of Chichester made Prof Hakim Adi redundant and cut his MRes on the history of Africa and the African diaspora. Prof Robert Beckford, the well-known theologian who researched climate and social justice, has been made redundant at the University of Winchester, and Birmingham City University (BCU) shuttered its black studies undergraduate course. While Goldsmiths, University of London reversed plans to cut its Black British literature MA, stating it would commit to running the course for another two years after an outcry, it recently made the founder and convener of the course, Prof Deirdre Obsorne, redundant. Kadija George Sesay, who was one of several writers to sign an open letter criticising the move, told the Guardian that she had returned her honorary fellowship to Goldsmiths. In the past decade, there were notable advances in the creation of dedicated lectureships, and broader curriculum development in black history, culture, politics and philosophy in higher education. This, as well as active mentoring and recruitment of academics of colour, led to improvements in the number of black professors in the UK. But universities say they are in the midst of a dire financial crisis and these courses, while expensive to run, are not as popular as they are in the US, where the discipline of black history and arts is more established. Campaigners say the courses and the lecturers’ specialist knowledge should be ringfenced and require time and development to have an impact. Even with recent improvements, fewer than 1% of professors are black. Beckford said: “The reality is I’ve never been in a job since 1993 which has been secure. I’ve always had the threat of redundancy because there was always a lack of funding for posts that were connected to race. I’ve never had that kind of luxury of knowing that I was in a place that was going to invest in me and give me lots of time to develop my craft.” Beckford, who alone supported 16 black PhD students, added: “You get a freeze on the development and mentoring by jettisoning people like me. My work has always been fundamentally about empowering black students, empowering black colleagues.” While the University of Winchester said it would not comment on individual cases, a spokesperson noted that “all the redundancies upon which we have consulted reflect the challenging financial circumstances facing the university sector”. Prof Kehinde Andrews, who leads Birmingham City University’s black studies department, said he was disappointed but not surprised when he was told the undergraduate course would be cut. “There’s no appreciation for the importance of black intellectual thought, so they get rid of it really easily. I think that’s what you’re seeing everywhere. “You can’t even call it erasure because there’s so little black production in Britain. It’ll be completely wiped out, there’ll be nothing left.” BCU declined to comment. Adi believes these cuts will have a dire impact on the number of black history professors in the UK. The masters course he oversaw produced seven students who went on to undertake studies at PhD level, six of them at Chichester. “We were particularly trying to redress the imbalance in higher education: the fact that there were so few students of African and Caribbean heritage studying history at postgraduate level in this country,” he said. The students on Adi’s course have launched a legal challenge against the university, alleging discrimination and breach of contract after it terminated the programme while they were part way through their studies. A spokesperson for the University of Chichester said while it had made the “difficult decision” to suspend a number of courses, current masters students “were encouraged to complete their studies with us and were offered appropriate tuition”. Osborne was heartbroken when her redundancy was confirmed earlier this month. “What kind of message does removing opportunities for access to that knowledge send to students and future generations of black creatives?” Dr Stephen Graham, Goldsmiths’ executive dean of faculty, said the MA programme provided a crucial platform for black scholarship and increased diversity within the academic community. “These were the reasons both behind the creation of the MA programme and our persistence in supporting it in the face of low recruitment numbers,” he said. He added he was aware of the concerns about the impact on black scholarship of the financial challenges universities face. A student on the Black British literature programme, who did not wish to be named, said: “I joined the course because of the professor, who is a leading academic in the space. I absolutely trusted her experience, vision and commitment – that has now been taken away. “New students have arrived from overseas who spoke to the professor, made a significant financial and personal commitment, and that professor is simply not there.” Graham said: “The course is being taught by two leading black scholars and over the next two years we will work to develop a more multidisciplinary programme that will help in attracting more students.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/13/uk-university-cuts-threaten-to-wipe-out-black-scholarship-academics-say,Education,2024-10-13T13:00:56Z,4
education/2025/nov/07/arts-leaders-hail-move-to-boost-creative-subjects-england-schools,‘Huge step in the right direction’: arts leaders hail move to boost creative subjects in England’s schools,"For years, Britain’s leading cultural figures have warned that substandard arts provision in schools is devaluing the sector and creating an increasingly elite industry. But the government’s proposed shake-up of the national curriculum, which includes scrapping the English baccalaureate (Ebacc), has been met with overwhelming positivity, with one figure saying it could end “the madness of the past decade”. On Wednesday the Department for Education said it wanted to boost the creative subjects taken at GCSE as part of its wider changes to England’s national curriculum. The changes were unveiled in the government’s response to the curriculum and assessment review published this week by Prof Becky Francis, which stated: “The arts subjects are an entitlement rather than an optional extra and are disciplines in their own right.” The playwright James Graham, who used his MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV festival last year to highlight class inequality in the arts, welcomed the end of “the madness of the past decade” in which culture subjects had been devalued. He said: “It’s important now to look to the future and use this as an opportunity to ask what a modern-day arts curriculum should look and feel like for 21st-century kids, and the challenging times they’re growing up.” The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber said he was pleased the government had acknowledged “what some of us have known for years: that arts and music in schools is a fundamental right for young people as part of a successful education”. But he added: “There is still no flesh on the bones in the government’s latest announcement. Fundamental questions remain around funding, the structure of the curriculum and, in the case of music, plans to address the chronic shortage of teachers in this country.” The Turner prize winner Antony Gormley said the “removal of the shadow of Michael Gove and his Ebacc is to be celebrated”, while the sculptor Anish Kapoor argued that the arts brought “a sense of empathy to our younger citizens – something which is deeply needed, especially now”. The number of UK students taking arts subjects has plummeted in recent years, leading to a creativity crisis in state schools. Since 2010, enrolment in arts GCSEs has fallen by 40% and the number of arts teachers has declined by 23%. Research last year found that a decade ago about half of all A-level students took at least one humanities subject. By 2021-22 that had fallen to 38%, with the proportion taking arts subjects such as music, design and media studies dropping to 24%. The latest GCSE data showed the situation had got even worse. Beth Steel, who has regularly campaigned for better working-class representation in the cultural sector, said art, music and drama “are not extracurricular subjects, they are foundational”. The Nottingham-born playwright said a school trip to the Tate and the National Gallery where she saw Rothko paintings as a 14-year-old was a pivotal moment for her. “That visit had a profound effect on me: it was a stepping stone on my path,” she said. “Our government’s decision to scrap the Ebacc and recognise this [issue] is such a huge step in the right direction and is essential for working-class children who may otherwise have no access.” The curriculum review argues that schools do not have enough time to pursue creative subjects, something several arts leaders said was often raised with them by teachers and others who work in education. Maria Balshaw, the director of the Tate, said the teachers she welcomed often complained about “not having space in the curriculum” for the arts. “We think that the creative subjects are vital to create stronger, more rounded, more resilient individuals and we welcome the review focusing on the idea of the arts and the ‘enrichment’ they offer,” she said. Indhu Rubasingham, the director and co-chief executive of the National Theatre, said that over the past decade she had spoken to drama teachers who had left the profession because their subject had been cut by their schools. She said: “We’ll do everything we can to support this next stage of work and ensure that the arts and creativity are at the heart of every school around the country. Without it, there is no way that someone like me would be where I am today.” As part of the shift in focus, the government is proposing changes to performance measures that would encourage take-up of arts GCSEs including music, dance and drama by scrapping the Ebacc suite of subjects. Abigail Pogson, the new chief executive of the Barbican, called the move a “critical shift in education”. She said: “I view it as a long-awaited recognition that we must educate our young people as whole, capable humans, not just minds to be trained.” Alistair Spalding, the artistic director and co-chief executive of Sadler’s Wells, said he was pleased to see a “commitment to strengthen the curriculum content for dance within PE”. He said he would like to see the recent decline in pupils taking the subject at GCSE and A-level reversed and he called for “investment in training to ensure there is a pipeline of teachers and talent in place”. Alex Beard, the chief executive of the Royal Ballet and Opera, said that in “increasingly digital, atomised and polarised times, the arts are needed more than ever” to develop critical thinking, empathy and common understanding. He said extending opportunity and access to the arts through the curriculum would also “help ensure that our art forms reflect the richness and diversity of society”. The saxophonist and composer YolanDa Brown said: “As someone who found my voice through a school saxophone, I know first-hand how life-changing great arts education can be. So I welcome any move that puts music and creativity back at the heart of the curriculum, not as an optional extra but as a right for every child.” Brown emphasised that the proposals must be matched with “proper investment and support for teachers”, including the provision of instruments and rehearsal space. “The real test will be whether a child in Newcastle has the same access as a child in Hammersmith; whether every school, not just the already well-resourced ones, can offer meaningful creative experiences,” she said. Nadia Fall, the artistic director of the Young Vic, said “putting arts back on the table for pupils” was “long overdue and critical”. She said: “It doesn’t mean that every pupil will pursue a career in the arts – though why not? There is a thriving industry out here and we need them. It’s about lighting up all parts of the brain and the person. “Einstein played the violin from the age of six; it wasn’t just a hobby, it helped him work out complex physics problems. Our education system is all too often forced to put things in boxes, however our brains aren’t necessarily designed that way and nor are the emerging industries of the future.” On Wednesday, Ed Sheeran praised the government’s move to overhaul the teaching of music in England’s state schools, having campaigned for change including by signing an open letter to Keir Starmer in January.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/nov/07/arts-leaders-hail-move-to-boost-creative-subjects-england-schools,Education,2025-11-07T08:00:21Z,3
education/2025/oct/23/one-in-12-secondary-pupils-put-in-isolation-rooms-at-least-once-a-week-study-finds,"One in 12 secondary pupils put in isolation rooms at least once a week, study finds","One in 12 secondary pupils report being put into school isolation rooms at least once a week where they often spend in excess of eight hours, missing more than a full day of lessons, according to research. Children with special educational needs were more than twice as likely to be placed in isolation, otherwise known as internal exclusion, while students from low-income backgrounds were also disproportionately affected. Pupils on free school meals were more than one-and-a-half times more likely to be placed in isolation than their wealthier peers, researchers found from self-reported data provided by pupils. Children who identified as LGBTQ+ were nearly twice as likely to be in isolation, while Black, Asian and mixed heritage children were also more likely to be in isolation than their white British peers, the research from the University of Manchester found. The use of isolation, and in particular isolation booths, has become a growing source of concern among some parents, who complain about an overly punitive system that harms their child’s education and mental health. Isolation usually involves removing a pupil from a class for disruptive behaviour and asking them to work alone or in silence in a separate room, but parents complain that children can be put into isolation for minor breaches of school rules, which those with complex behaviours and special needs may find difficult to adhere to. Unlike suspensions or permanent exclusions, there are no national rules on how isolation should be used, or for how long, and there is no publicly available national data. The Manchester study, published in the British Educational Research Journal, is the first large-scale investigation into internal exclusion. The researchers say it shows the practice is more widespread and harmful than parents or school leaders realise. They analysed survey data from the #BeeWell programme, a study of young people’s wellbeing based on a survey of 34,000 pupils at 121 mainstream secondary schools across Greater Manchester. They found that 8.3% reported being placed in isolation at least once a week, and the average time pupils said they spent in isolation was 8.5 hours a week. Those put into isolation complained that their sense of belonging suffered, they had poorer relationships with teachers and lower levels of mental wellbeing. “Internal exclusion is happening every day in classrooms across England, yet it is largely hidden from view,” said the report’s lead author, Emma Thornton. “We know that it can provide an effective short-term solution for teachers dealing with disruption in their class who want to create the conditions for all pupils to thrive. “But our findings show that it is disproportionately applied to young people most in need of support, and leads to lost learning, weaker connections with teachers, and in some cases poorer mental health.” Earlier this year the high court upheld the use of isolation booths by schools in England, dashing the hopes of campaigners who claim they are stressful and stigmatising for pupils. Lawyers for three families argued that prolonged use of isolation booths for disruptive or violent behaviour was depriving children of an education at John Smeaton academy in Leeds. One child had spent 83 days in isolation and 14 days suspended – more than half the school year. Mrs Justice Collins Rice found the school had not “crossed the boundaries of what the law or good practice permits”, despite questions about the “reasonableness” of the policy and the lack of alternatives. The lead professor of #BeeWell, Neil Humphrey, said: “We know schools face huge pressures in managing behaviour, but our evidence suggests isolation is not the solution. “We need investment in positive behaviour support, restorative approaches and better mental health provision – strategies that keep children connected to their learning and their school community.” Kiran Gill of The Difference, an education charity for whole school inclusion, said: “What’s needed is more research and practice-sharing on effective ways to set up internal spaces that are diagnostic, supportive and get children back to class as soon as possible.” Ellie Costello of Not Fine in School, which supports children and families struggling with school attendance, wants the government to ensure mandatory reporting of the use of isolation in mainstream schools, as is already the case with suspensions and exclusions. Tom Bennett, a former teacher and adviser to the Department for Education (DfE) on behaviour policy, said: “When students persistently disrupt lessons, or attack or harass students or staff in lessons, schools have little choice but to remove the students temporarily from lessons. “What other choice do they have? This is yet another attack on the duty of schools to keep students safe and free from abuse, by people with an axe to grind against all forms of adult authority.” A DfE spokesperson said there should be high expectations around pupil behaviour and schools should expect parents to back them. “We are determined to get to grips with the causes of poor behaviour – including through access to specialist mental health professionals in every secondary school,” they said.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/23/one-in-12-secondary-pupils-put-in-isolation-rooms-at-least-once-a-week-study-finds,Education,2025-10-23T05:00:59Z,3
education/2025/sep/13/drinks-party-guide-student-nightlife,Partial to pre-drinks and a party? Your guide to getting the most out of student nightlife,"Choosing which university to attend based on social scene alone probably isn’t the wisest idea, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t rank high on your list of priorities. Not only are sticky dancefloors and blinding strobe lighting a sort of rite of passage, a good night out can foster the sense of connection and friendship that is key to a student’s wellbeing. “Three years minimum is a long time in your life, so you need to be happy in the environment you’re in,” says Joe Woodcock, head of community at discussion platform The Student Room. “Students who are not happy tend to be the ones that aren’t able to finish. Being a happy student is so important for getting the best out of your university education.” That doesn’t mean it’s all budget bottles of vodka and arguing about whose turn it is to pay for the Uber. History and politics student Joseph Thomas, 21, chose the University of York because the city’s nightlife seemed “a bit more down to earth and a bit less rowdy” than his second choice – Coventry’s University of Warwick. “A campus university was right for me because all the students are in one place.” His idea of a good time is playing communal Mario Kart on a projector and discussing music over a couple of pints with the university album society. Similarly, Rachel Tong Ng, who has just graduated with a degree in business and management, chose Durham University over Manchester for its “more peaceful vibe”. “Durham has a collegiate system, which I’d researched before, so I think it was a lot easier to make friends,” says Ng, who preferred society events and on-campus sports team socials – both of which her chosen city had in abundance – to pubs and clubs. But don’t believe everything they tell you about gen Z, says Katie Kirwan, the head of brand at booking platform Design My Night – they’re as partial to a party as their predecessors – they’re just more discerning about where they choose to blow their student loan. “A couple of years ago we started covering a lot of nights based around musicians – so we had a ton of Taylor Swift nights, and we’ve seen a huge increase in searches for western-themed nights following the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album,” says Kirwan. “Britney [Spears] nights have also made a comeback. Nostalgia’s big: gen Z are now discovering all the bands that I used to listen to when I was their age.” Demand for activities-based nights out, including pottery painting and crafting, is also skyrocketing – with their fixed cost one of the main draws, says Kirwan. As well as a 14% increase in searches for “classes” in the past year on the platform, she’s seen a 43% increase in searches for “affordable” activities. The eye-watering cost of going out now means that the time-honoured student tradition of cramming into the communal kitchen for pre-drinks is alive and well. “A lot of us do most of our drinking before we go to the club,” says 19-year-old animation student Kami Thomas, who chose the University of Westminster so they could take advantage of London’s LGBTQ+ clubbing scene. They have also used holiday work to give their bank account some breathing room: “I knew I wanted to go to university in London, so I saved £3,000 over the summer so I could enjoy my first term.” Ng’s number one rule for affordable student socialising is setting a budget before she goes out, and refusing to overspend – even if that means one less drink. So which universities make the grade for their social scenes? “A city like Sheffield ticks all the boxes for diverse, great nightlife,” says Woodcock. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The University of Sheffield’s student union is frequently ranked best in the UK, while the city’s DIY music scene continues to thrive. “Places like Liverpool and Cardiff, which are cheaper than London and the south-east, also offer the best of both: a campus-centred social scene and city nightlife,” he adds. For live music, Kirwan recommends Leeds, which has “all the flavour of Manchester” with a cheaper cost of living. Ng, though, doesn’t think it matters where you go – provided you try to enjoy yourself as much as possible. “You only get the university experience once.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/drinks-party-guide-student-nightlife,Education,2025-09-13T12:00:03Z,3
education/2025/jul/22/harvard-educational-review-palestine-issue-cancelled,Revealed: Harvard publisher cancels entire journal issue on Palestine shortly before publication,"In March 2024, six months into Israel’s war in Gaza, education in the territory was decimated. Schools were closed – most had been turned into shelters – and all 12 of the strip’s universities were partially or fully destroyed. Against that backdrop, a prestigious American education journal decided to dedicate a special issue to “education and Palestine”. The Harvard Educational Review (HER) put out a call for submissions, asking academics around the world for ideas for articles grappling with the education of Palestinians, education about Palestine and Palestinians, and related debates in schools and colleges in the US. “The field of education has an important role to play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing what has been happening in Gaza with histories and continuing impacts of occupation, genocide, and political contestations,” the journal’s editors wrote in their call for abstracts. A little more than a year later, the scale of destruction in Gaza was exponentially larger. The special issue, which was slated to be published this summer, was just about ready – contracts with most authors were finalized and articles were edited. They covered topics from the annihilation of Gaza’s schools to the challenges of teaching about Israel and Palestine in the US. But on 9 June, the Harvard Education Publishing Group, the journal’s publisher, abruptly canceled the release. In an email to the issue’s contributors, the publisher cited “a number of complex issues”, shocking authors and editors alike, the Guardian has learned. US universities have come under intensifying attacks from the Trump administration over accusations of tolerating antisemitism on campuses. Many have responded by restricting protest, punishing students and faculty outspoken about Palestinian rights, and scrutinizing academic programs home to scholarship about Palestine. But the cancellation of an entire issue of an academic journal, which has not been previously reported, is a remarkable new development in a mounting list of examples of censorship of pro-Palestinian speech. The Guardian spoke with four scholars who had written for the issue, and one of the journal’s editors. It also reviewed internal emails that capture how enthusiasm about a special issue intended to promote “scholarly conversation on education and Palestine amid repression, occupation, and genocide” was derailed by fears of legal liability and devolved into recriminations about censorship, integrity and what many scholars have come to refer to as the “Palestine exception” to academic freedom. Paul Belsito, a spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote in a statement to the Guardian that the decision to cancel the special issue followed nine months of conversations and an “overall lack of internal alignment” about the issue. The authors see it differently. “If the universities – or in this case a university press – are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don’t know what they’re doing. What’s the point?” said Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard College, the women’s school affiliated with Columbia University, who was one of the solicited authors. Harvard has been embroiled in a bitter battle with the Trump administration over millions in federal funding cuts and the revocation of its eligibility to host international students. In April, it became the first and so far only university to sue the administration, earning praise for its resistance to Trump’s onslaught. But Harvard has also cracked down on Palestine scholarship, demoting scholars and canceling related programs. “Harvard is being held up as the heroic institution, but what’s happening internally is much more complicated,” said Abu El-Haj. In January, as part of a legal settlement with Jewish students who had accused Harvard of tolerating and promoting antisemitism on campus, the university adopted a controversial definition that critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel. In an email to the authors announcing the cancellation, the executive director of the publishing group did not cite antisemitism; she wrote the decision stemmed from what she described as an inadequate review process and the need for “considerable copy editing”. The journal’s editorial board rejected that characterization and said they had been sidelined by the publisher in making the decision. The decision to cancel the issue was “out of alignment with the values that have guided HER for nearly a century”, the board members wrote in a collective statement. The announcement came after the publishers had demanded that the articles be submitted to a legal review late into the process – a step the authors found highly unusual and called a “dangerous form of institutional censorship” in a joint letter objecting to the demand. The publisher’s request was prompted by fear the issue would attract antisemitism claims, said one editor. The dispute underscores the unprecedented restraints placed on knowledge production amid escalating accusations of antisemitism on campuses and the Trump administration’s crusade against higher education. But it also signals the levels to which universities are abandoning their stated commitments out of fears of legal or financial repercussions. “Even within the broader landscape around Palestine in the university, it’s unprecedented,” said Chandni Desai, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of one of the scrapped articles. “You just don’t … have people sign contracts, advertise the articles, and then cancel not just one article, but an entire special issue.” Tensions boil over The Harvard Educational Review is a century-old academic journal that publishes research and opinion geared to education academics and professionals and is considered a leading publication in the field. It is published by the Harvard Education Publishing Group, a division of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and edited by doctoral students at the university. The Palestine issue was slated to include a dozen research articles, essays and other writings on topics ranging from education in Israel-Palestine and among the Palestinian diaspora, to academic freedom in the US. They explored the evolution of the concept of “scholasticide”, a term describing the systematic annihilation of education first coined during Israel’s 2008 invasion of Gaza; the “ethical and educational responsibilities” of English language teachers in the West Bank; and the impact of “crackdowns on dissent” on teaching about Palestine in US higher education institutions, according to finalized abstracts of the articles shared with the Guardian. Abu El-Haj’s piece, co-authored with two other scholars, explored the “centrality of education in the struggle for Palestinian liberation”, drawing from an oral history project on the experiences of teachers with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The journal’s editors were so enthusiastic about her piece that last spring they selected it with two others to promote the upcoming special issue on the back cover of the spring one. The special issue was also formally announced at an annual gathering of education scholars in Chicago in March. “There was quite a lot of interest in it,” said Jo Kelcey, a professor at the Lebanese American University in Beirut and one of Abu El-Haj’s co-authors. The authors received the first inkling of trouble shortly after that. Rabea Eghbariah, a Palestinian doctoral candidate at Harvard Law School, had been solicited to write the afterword for the special issue. In 2023, a different Harvard journal, the Harvard Law Review, had blocked publication of an article it had commissioned from him. When the Columbia Law Review published the piece instead, that journal’s board responded by temporarily shutting down its entire website. Wary of that experience, Eghbariah specifically requested to amend his contract with the Harvard Educational Review to add a clause seeking to safeguard his academic freedom. After a long silence, the journal declined his request in April. “It is incredibly shameful to see a university publication so explicitly betraying its mission and rejecting a clause on protecting academic freedom,” said Eghbariah, who did not sign the contract. “My afterword specifically is about Nakba denialism – the phenomenon of manipulating facts to affirm Zionism and shape knowledge with regards to Palestine – and it is quite ironic that it is being denied publication.” Days after their response to Eghbariah, the journal’s editorial board wrote to the authors, citing an “increasingly challenging climate” and asking for their availability for a meeting, which never ended up happening. “As a part of a scholarly community deeply committed to uplifting Palestinian voices and scholarship, we are facing some increasingly unprecedented contexts,” they wrote. The email offered little detail, but for weeks, the journal’s editors had been under mounting pressure from the publisher. In January, they were told that an “institutional review” of the manuscripts would be required. In February, the publisher tried – without the editors’ knowledge – to alter the back cover of the spring issue promoting some of the forthcoming articles, according to email correspondence reviewed by the Guardian. (The printing company flagged the change to the editors, who reversed it.) In conversations with the editors – although not in writing – the publisher acknowledged that it was seeking a “risk assessment” legal review by Harvard’s counsel out of fear the issue’s publication would prompt antisemitism claims, an editor said. As tensions came to a head, the board again contacted the authors in early May, to inform them of the requested legal review. It was an extraordinary demand, the authors and editor interviewed by the Guardian said. Legal reviews would sometimes be requested for a specific article when there is a libel concern – but early in the process, and not for an entire issue, they noted. “This doesn’t happen, certainly not at the point where you’ve been accepted for publication and you’ve signed contracts,” said Kelcey. “This is not the way scholarship is supposed to operate.” By then, the Trump administration had upended higher education by threatening billions of dollars in funding from universities in the US over their responses to pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard had sued in April, escalating its feud with the president. The authors, who hadn’t initially been in touch, found each other and organised a collective response, slamming the request for a legal review at that stage as “unprecedented”, they wrote in a 15 May letter to the journal’s editorial board and publisher. “This sends a dangerous message to scholars globally: that academic publishing contracts are conditional, revocable, and subject to external political calculations.” The authors asked for the legal review to be reconsidered. But less than a month later, the press’s executive director, Jessica Fiorillo, wrote to them that the issue was being pulled altogether. In an email seen by the Guardian, she claimed the manuscripts were “unready for publication”, in part due to a copy editor’s resignation. She also cited an unspecified “failure to adhere to an adequate review process”, a “lack of internal alignment” between the authors, editors and the publisher, and “the lack of a clear and expedient path forward to resolving the myriad issues at play”. “This difficult situation is exacerbated by very significant lack of agreement about the path forward, including and especially whether to publish such a special issue at this time,” she wrote. The copy-editing issue wasn’t just a personnel one. The publisher’s letter claimed that the review editors “provided highly restrictive editing guidelines to the copy editor under contract to work on the special issue, limiting her focus to grammar, punctuation, and syntax errors, and directing her to refrain from offering any editorial suggestions to address, in the editors’ words, ‘politically charged’ content”. It claimed that the copy editor resigned in large part because of those restrictions. Fiorillo added that it would be “entirely appropriate” to subject the work to legal checks for “any libelous or unlawful material” but that no such review had taken place. She added that the cancellation was not “due to censorship of a particular viewpoint nor does it connect to matters of academic freedom”. A ‘deep loss’ The journal’s editors were blindsided. “The Editorial Board has not been made privy to any internal decision-making at HEPG regarding the Special Issue, and we only learned about this communication and decision 30 minutes before it was sent out,” they wrote to the authors shortly after Fiorillo’s email. In a longer letter to the authors, two days later, they rebutted Fiorillo’s claims about irregularities in the review process and expressed disappointment with the decision to cancel the issue. “It is a deep loss that your work will not appear in the pages of [Harvard Educational Review] as we intended – for HER, for the field of education, and for social justice,” they wrote. Regarding the publisher’s claim regarding overly restrictive copy-editing guidelines, the editors said that they were asked by the publisher to develop copy-editing guidelines – something that hadn’t been required for previous issues – and that they invited feedback at multiple points in the process. It is not clear how far up within Harvard’s administration the decision to cancel the issue had come from. Belsito, the spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote that Harvard’s office of the general counsel does not “make or direct editorial decisions” for the school or its publishing group. “HEPG acknowledges the disappointment this decision may have caused for the authors and remains deeply committed to our robust editorial process, only publishing work of the highest scholarly quality through a process rooted in integrity, collaboration, and editorial rigor,” he added. The Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors which got involved after learning about the cancellation, believes the decision came from the publisher. “To us, it sounded like a textbook example of the killing of speech and academic inquiry related to Palestine,” said Kirsten Weld, a history professor and the chapter’s president. “Thus far, though our fact-finding remains incomplete, it looks like the impetus came from Harvard Education Publishing Group.” One of the editors of the Harvard Educational Review, who asked for anonymity citing the repressive climate in academia, said that the pressure from the publisher on the editors ramped up shortly before Trump took office. The request to subject the entirety of the edited manuscripts to a risk assessment was “totally abnormal” the editor said. “I didn’t even know the [office of the general counsel] review was an option, I had never heard of it.” The censorship of the issue, the editor added, is “exactly how authoritarianism grows”. The members of the editorial board who worked on the issue said that they had done their best to “advance this work amidst a climate of repression and institutional accommodation”. “As we reflect on this moment, we urge the scholarly community to defend the ability to publish rigorous, justice-oriented scholarship without interference and repression,” they added. The ordeal was a “test case” for academic freedom, said Desai, whose article on scholasticide, co-written with three Palestinian colleagues, was also directly solicited and advertised on the back of the spring journal issue. (It was the teaser to their article that the publishers tried to remove from the back of the previous issue, without the editors’ knowledge.) Desai criticized the cancellation as a “serious breach and violation of academic freedom and integrity” but also an affront to the labor of scholars who are “writing these articles during a genocide”. She and her co-authors, including a dean at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, were not merely documenting the resilience of Palestinian education amid the destruction but were personally involved in those efforts, she noted. Many of their colleagues and students were killed as the group worked on the article. “This is not some abstract academic exercise,” said Desai. “I can’t keep stressing the urgency of this article as we’re watching universities being blown up.” The authors are in talks with other journals and hope their pieces can be published together as planned. All those interviewed by the Guardian expressed fear that the incident would deter other scholars from pursuing work on Palestine – a longstanding problem that they say has only been exacerbated over the last two years. “There’s this risk of kind of closing down the democratic space,” said Kelcey. As Israel and Palestine have become the flashpoint for a rapidly deteriorating climate for free speech and academic freedom in the US, Harvard has already demoted two faculty members leading the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (one of whom wrote the forward for the cancelled issue), suspended a partnership with Birzeit University in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and ended a divinity school initiative dedicated to the conflict. Scholars fear that the the capitulation of universities is hurting an entire field of study at the time when it’s most needed. But Abu El-Haj warned that the special issue’s cancellation also set a dangerous precedent for the independence of scholarship on a variety of subjects. She accused the publisher of “anticipatory compliance” and warned that “it’s not going to stop with Palestine,” she said. But she also sounded a note of optimism. In a sign of the growing chasm between decision-makers and the broader public on the issue, she said that the war in Gaza had led to unprecedented interest among students in Palestine coursework and scholarship. She recalled being a student in the US during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Israeli-backed Lebanese militias. “There were three of us protesting,” she recalled. “I never would have imagined in my life I’d see the encampments that happened last year. “We’re in a really critical juncture,” she added. “The level of repression that we’re seeing is related to the shift in the narrative, and the loss of control over that narrative.” • This story was amended on 23 July 2025.

education/2025/sep/23/majority-of-girls-and-young-women-in-uk-alter-behaviour-to-feel-safe-study-finds,"Majority of girls and young women in UK alter behaviour to feel safe, study finds","Two-thirds of girls and young women have changed their everyday behaviour to try to stay safe, with 31% avoiding taking public transport alone, according to a survey by the Girlguiding charity. The research found that 56% of girls and young women in the UK aged between 11 and 21 said they feel unsafe travelling by themselves, up from 45% in 2022, while almost one-third said they avoided public transport altogether. Girlguiding’s annual Girls’ Attitudes survey found that 86% of respondents have avoided going out after dark to stay safe, with girls of colour less likely to step out. Overall, 68% said they changed their everyday behaviour to avoid being sexually harassed, with one in three (32%) altering what they wear. More than a quarter (28%) of the 2,640 respondents said they had avoided places where they used to socialise and one in 10 (12%) changed where they exercise. Girls with disabilities felt particularly unsafe travelling, with only 17% saying they felt secure on public transport, compared with 33% of non-disabled girls. The survey also explored misogyny in schools. More than half of girls aged 11 to 18 (58%) said they had experienced male pupils making toxic comments while 32% reported seeing a teacher or member of staff subjected to sexist or misogynistic abuse. One in 10 girls aged 11 to 16 said they do not feel safe at school, a figure that rises to more than two in 10 for LGBTQ+ girls and three in 10 for disabled girls. One in 10 also said they had intentionally missed school to lower the risk of sexual harassment – a figure that doubles for girls with disabilities (21%) and rises to 18% for neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ girls. Among the younger pupils, a third of girls aged seven to 10 (32%) said they had experienced a comment from boys at school that made them feel uncomfortable while, 17% said boys at school regularly comment on the bodies of girls and young women. Girlguiding called on local authorities and schools to publish plans to tackle misogyny in their communities and for politicians in charge of public transport to engage with girls on their fears and make services safer. Amanda Azeez, the acting chief executive of Girlguiding, said: “Although a lot of progress has been made in creating an equal world, reading these stark findings makes us realise that in some areas, like the treatment and behaviour that girls’ face, things sadly haven’t changed at all. “Girls are not being treated equally and are consistently made to feel like they’re not enough. This is not only affecting their mental health but stopping them from being themselves. “To ensure girls’ safety and to tackle this issue, action needs to happen now, starting with listening to and involving girls and young women in how to address this. Girls should be able to rely on decision-makers to keep them safe, as well as their peers for support.” The research also highlighted how girls and young women have supported each other, with 70% of 11- to 21-year-olds saying they have stood up for other girls experiencing sexism or misogyny.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/23/majority-of-girls-and-young-women-in-uk-alter-behaviour-to-feel-safe-study-finds,Education,2025-09-22T23:01:32Z,2
education/2025/may/22/uk-government-urged-to-introduce-gcse-in-ukrainian-for-child-refugees,UK government urged to introduce GCSE in Ukrainian for child refugees,"The children’s commissioner has joined Kyiv in lobbying the UK government to introduce a new GCSE in Ukrainian to help child refugees cope with the “immense upheaval” of fleeing war in their country. In December, the Guardian revealed that Ukraine was “deeply concerned” to discover many Ukrainian teenagers are being pressed into learning Russian in British schools because no GSCE in Ukrainian is available. Since then Ukraine’s education minister, Oksen Lisovyi, has met the UK education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, to underline his government’s fear that being taught Russian is retraumatising Ukrainian teenagers who have fled Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Vitalii, now 18, who fled to London from Ukraine in April 2022, said: “Why should I study Russian – I’m Ukrainian and I want to show it. The language is paramount for all us.” Since the meeting with Lisovyi, Phillipson confirmed on Instagram this week that she has written to exam boards urging them to reintroduce an exam that was scrapped in 1995 owing to a lack of demand. The Department for Education (DfE) has also set up a working group to help implement the move. One of the exam boards, AQA, said it was carefully considering reintroducing the qualification. But education sector insiders are sceptical about the practicalities of the move. It has also emerged the children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, has been urging the government to reintroduce a GCSE in Ukrainain. She intervened after visiting St Mary’s, a network of 13 Ukrainian language schools in the UK, founded at the trust’s headquarters in west London. De Souza said: “I’ve seen for myself the great work St Mary’s Ukrainian School is doing with the children who attend. It has become a sanctuary for families, helping displaced children reach their goals and aspirations in spite of the immense upheaval they’ve experienced.” De Souza said she was encouraged by the DfE’s decision to take up the issue with exam boards. She said: “I have long called for the DfE to consider making qualifications available in Ukrainian for these children, who rightly want an opportunity to feel proud of their culture and their language, so I am really pleased to see this. “Ukrainian children living here in the UK are the future of their country and will play a vital role in its recovery, so we must match their level of ambition and make sure they receive all the support possible to thrive in their education.” An AQA spokesperson said: “We’ve every sympathy with Ukrainian students who, through no fault of their own, find themselves many miles from home and want to gain formal accreditation of their language. “As an education charity, we stand ready to do what we can to support Ukrainian students. We have received a letter from the education secretary about developing a GCSE in the Ukrainian language and are considering it carefully.” But an education industry source said: “Realistically it takes two years to develop a qualification, it takes another two years to teach it. So a GCSE is not going to help students who are currently here who have fled Ukraine.” St Mary’s has proposed becoming a hub for both GCSE and A-level qualifications in Ukrainian. In a letter to Phillipson, Ukraine’s ministry of education backed this suggestion. It said: “Establishing a Ukrainian GCSE centre will provide these children with opportunities to take Ukrainian GCSE and A-level exams, supporting their educational and professional goals.” It also pointed out that demand for the qualification has soared owing to the number of children that have fled to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. It said: “As of now, the number of potential students of Ukrainian descent interested in pursuing Ukrainian GCSE is at an all-time high: about 27,000 displaced Ukrainian children and around 7,000 diaspora children.” It added: “Maintaining proficiency in Ukrainian is crucial for displaced children’s transition back to Ukraine, especially as many families may decide to reunite when it is safe.” A DfE spokesperson said: “This government has set out our decisive support for our Ukrainian friends. That’s why we have, last week, asked exam boards to consider introducing a Ukrainian GCSE – giving these young people the chance to celebrate their heritage and their native language.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/may/22/uk-government-urged-to-introduce-gcse-in-ukrainian-for-child-refugees,Education,2025-05-22T10:00:47Z,2
education/2024/dec/17/liam-o-bruadair-obituary,Liam Ó Bruadair obituary,"Liam Ó Bruadair, who has died aged 86, was my father’s best friend. In the late 1960s, Liam, a working-class man from Belfast, and his, wife Cristín McGuinness, together with eight other couples, including his brother, Donnchadh, and his wife, decided they wished to raise their families in the Irish language, which they had all learned to speak as adults. Knowing that the language would have to be reinforced outside the home, they built nine houses on the Shaws Road on the outskirts of West Belfast, and opened a primary school, Bunscoil Phobal Feirste, in 1971. At a time when a hostile unionist establishment still ruled at Stormont, it was the first Irish-medium school in Belfast in centuries. They had to fund it themselves until 1984, when the Department of Education (Northern Ireland) took it over; initially it catered for nine pupils in a portable building. Today it has 400 pupils and a modern building. Liam was born in the Docks area, the second of eight children of Samuel Broderick (the English spelling of the family name), a berthing master, and Eilís Monaghan. Liam went to the Star of the Sea elementary school and the Christian Brothers technical school, both in Belfast, and later became an apprentice carpenter. He was a keen boxer, played Gaelic football and knew he was going to marry Cristín, a hairdresser, after their first date; they married in 1966 and had seven children. In his 40s, Liam took night classes and became a lecturer at the Municipal Technical College (now Belfast Met). The school proved inspirational in Belfast and across the north of Ireland. There are now nine such primary schools and a thriving secondary school, Coláiste Feirste. And there are 40 Irish-medium preschools and primary schools across the north, to be found in every one of the six counties, along with two secondary schools plus four Irish-medium units in English-medium schools. About 5,000 pupils attend the primary schools, with approximately 1,500 in secondary schools. Liam’s nephew, Diarmaid Ua Bruadair, is principal of the secondary school in Dungiven, County Derry. I hated Irish in my teens. It was compulsory in my grammar school and it seemed irrelevant, but always lingering in the background were Liam, Cristín and their family, their presence giving me a sense that I was missing something. My daughters are now growing up bilingual, as did two of their cousins, who went to the Shaws Road school. At Liam’s funeral many people switched casually back and forth between Irish and English as they paid their respects. Cristín died in 2018, and their son Fiontán in 2020.

education/article/2024/aug/17/it-enriches-your-mind-in-every-way-the-fight-to-keep-the-uk-learning-german,‘It enriches your mind in every way’: the fight to keep the UK learning German,"When Londoner Amber Tallon started learning German at the age of 12, she “took to it like a duck to water”, she says. An A-level in the language and modules in German at the University of Oxford, where she studied history, have helped her, now 30, to her “dream job”, working as a Blue Badge Guide in London, where some of the large range of tours she offers are to German students. “As English people we have such a bad rap for not learning languages, assuming that everyone is going to speak English. I think it’s just polite to learn even the basics of the language … it puts you on the right foot,” she says. She volunteers a few of her favourite German compound words, to illustrate “how creative a language it is … the heart of the matter captured in a single word”. “Schokoladenseite”, which translates literally as chocolate side and means a person’s good side, and “Kabelsalat” (tangled cables), are two of her treasured gems, both nodding to the American humorist Mark Twain, who wrote in 1880 that acquiring the “art of German” was akin to assembling a collection of “alphabet processions”. Caroline Wyatt, a BBC presenter whose long career as a foreign correspondent started in Berlin in the early 90s thanks to her German language skills, says learning German “really enriched my life as a human being”. “It takes away the fear … because thanks to the language, you think: ‘I can understand this place.’” As a result, she recalls being “perfectly happy” when she secured a job as a business correspondent for the BBC World Service in Berlin in 1993 in her mid-20s “to slip a suitcase in the back of a car, head to Harwich, get on a ferry and drive to Berlin before satnav. “It wasn’t that it wasn’t scary, but it just felt like the world was opening up.” Tallon and Wyatt are something of a rarity these days, with the number of pupils having chosen to study German at A-Level in 2024 standing at just 2,261. Entries for German have more than halved over the last decade, there is an increasing dearth of German teachers (not helped by Brexit) and some higher education institutes are considering closing down their German departments. The decline has prompted a wider community of German scholars, with diplomats and the occasional politician, to search for creative ways to prevent German being consigned to the academic scrapheap. Next month, the Association for German Studies in Great Britain and Ireland will meet for its 92nd annual conference, hosted by the German department at the University of Leeds, to discuss the future of studying the language. One of its keynote speakers, the German ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, is behind the initiative “Making the Case for German”, together with the Goethe Institut, and the UK Department for Education’s (DoE) German promotion programme – a joint effort with the British Council to re-energise language learning in state-maintained primary and secondary schools in the UK. Hatched under the last government, all participants hope the latter project will also be embraced by the new administration. Berger says the aim is “to make German once again a more popular choice for language learners in the UK”. Andrea Pfeil, the Goethe Institut’s head of language for north west Europe, says language skills are still needed in the job market in the UK, where “German is the most sought-after foreign language … especially since Brexit”. Knowledge of German appeals to employers above and beyond the ability to speak it, Pfeil says. “Applicants with A-level German have a veritable Alleinstellungsmerkmal (a unique selling point), because they demonstrate a level of overall competence that gives them better access to the job market. “This is something that parents are often more interested in than pupils initially. This also goes for the fact that Britons with German language skills can study in Germany, where there are, in general, no student fees, which is a huge advantage.” Pfeil believes German learning could thrive in the long term if more people become aware of its advantages. The Goethe Institut, with the DoE, has also engaged the talents of Axel Scheffler, the UK-based German illustrator of The Gruffalo and other Julia Donaldson characters, in the hope of boosting enthusiasm for German language learning in primary schools and helping its progress in secondary schools and beyond. Scheffler has produced illustrations for a series of stories about an alien who arrives in Germany, aimed at encouraging an interest in the language. “It’s obvious the earlier you start the better, and that learning foreign languages is important especially in this country, especially after Brexit which I think closed Britain off more from the rest of Europe,” Scheffler says. “Being bilingual myself and living in another language, I think any other language enriches one’s mind, one’s chances in life in every way, the openness to other cultures.” Henning Wehn, the German standup comic who came to Britain more than 20 years ago hardly able to speak English, who was recently credited by King Charles for having “given us an understanding of German quirks”, says language learning is crucial to “opening your mind”, but believes all the teaching in the world is no replacement for immersion in the country itself. “The only time you really learn the language is living in the country … you become part of the fabric. Google Translate is no substitute for connecting, for understanding the jokes, or Only Fools and Horses.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/aug/17/it-enriches-your-mind-in-every-way-the-fight-to-keep-the-uk-learning-german,Education,2024-08-17T09:00:03Z,2
education/article/2024/jul/12/hilary-hester-ives-obituary,Hilary Hester Ives obituary,"My friend and former colleague Hilary Hester Ives, who has died aged 88, was an expert on teaching bilingual children. Working from the Inner London Education Authority (Ilea) and the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education from the late 1960s to the 90s, Hilary developed a pedagogy that focused on developing the language skills of children at different stages of learning English through collaborative group work in the mainstream classroom – and in the context of a curriculum appropriate for a changing multicultural society. Based on extensive research by teachers throughout the country, this was widely disseminated to teachers through in-service training. Hilary was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, to Len Shreeves, a soldier, and his wife, Joan, a shopkeeper. Educated at Guildford grammar school for girls, she qualified as a teacher in 1955 after studying at Whitelands College in Roehampton, south-west London, where she met John Hester. They married in 1956, and after a spell teaching in a Reading primary school, she and John moved to Ethiopia in 1958 with their baby son, Simon. Hilary taught English in secondary schools in Addis Ababa, where a second child, Siân, was born, but she disliked the stultifying expatriate life and returned to the UK in 1964. For the next two years she taught in primary schools in Harlow, Essex, and in London, until the Schools Council Project took her on secondment in 1967 as a teacher and writer on its English for Immigrant Children programme. The same year she and John were divorced. In 1970 Hilary moved to Ilea’s Centre for Urban Educational Studies (Cues) as a senior lecturer, leading curriculum development projects and training in-service teachers for the next 16 years. For a period from 1982 to 1984 she was also seconded to the Schools Council to direct its Language in the Multicultural Primary Classroom programme, on which I worked with her. In 1986 Hilary left Cues to join the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education, where she developed Hester’s Stages of English Learning, which was widely used by local education authorities in the UK, and where she remained until her retirement in 1994. In the same year that she and John were divorced, she married an old friend, John Ives, with whom she shared an active life of hiking, camping and sailing along the coast of East Anglia. When he died in 1994 she got together with Larry Grant, who had also recently been bereaved, and they lived in Southwold in Suffolk, where she joined a women’s sea swimming group and developed a beautiful garden at their home. After Larry died in 2003 Hilary returned to London “to get away from the Daily Mail readers”, and lived an independent life in Tufnell Park in a big house full of books and colour. In 2020 she had a serious fall and moved to a care home. She is survived by her children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/jul/12/hilary-hester-ives-obituary,Education,2024-07-12T14:54:51Z,2
education/article/2024/jul/04/maggie-ross-obituary,Maggie Ross obituary,"My wife, Maggie Ross, who has died suddenly aged 73, was an inspiring early years educator, who brought practical compassion and understanding in supporting the families of young children. As the manager of nurseries and early years centres in London, she had a particular flair for helping her staff to aspire to develop their careers. Born in Bristol, Maggie was the daughter of Barbara (nee Bees) and John Beall, a vicar and educator. She spent some of her early life in Kerala, south India, where her father taught, before returning to parishes in Bristol and then Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire. She went to Accrington high school. Maggie and I first met in late 1971 at Soas University of London, where she was taking a BA in linguistics and social anthropology; we married the following year. She trained as an early years teacher, and then took a course in teaching bilingual children at the Inner London Education Authority’s centre for urban educational studies. Her experience of teaching groups of young children in Hackney, coupled with her understanding of linguistic development, led her to realise that bilingual young children’s language competence depended on them maintaining their home language as an essential precondition to learning English. She put this into practice, in 1977 joining Thomas Buxton Infants school in Tower Hamlets, where the school population was largely of Bangladeshi origin. With the help of parents and committed colleagues, she pioneered the use of dual language “real books” with young children. After a short break when our children, Susanna and David, were born, she moved to teach in the nursery class at Highbury Quadrant primary school. Pupils had a diverse range of languages, and the school was targeted with racial abuse – and vilified by elements of the press when the staff held a 70th birthday party for Nelson Mandela in 1988. In the summer of 1990 Maggie rose to a very different challenge. When she and I were taking our children, aged six and nine, to holiday in south India, our plane stopped to refuel in Kuwait just as Iraqi forces were invading. Passengers and crew became hostages of Saddam Hussein, and for a month we were held in dire conditions, partly on a nuclear site. Maggie supported our children through this with calmness and determination. After four weeks, women and children were freed, and she re-joined her school in London the next day, as the term started, combining teaching with campaigning for my release, which came over three months later. In the late 1990s she moved to the University of North London to lecture in early years education and language. Missing daily contact with young children, she returned to work in early years centres. Between 2001 and 2011 she managed three nurseries in Islington and north Westminster: Springdale, Dorothy Gardner and New River Green. There she combined her experience of teaching professional courses with a talent for identifying potential in people. She encouraged her staff to gain qualifications and advance their careers, in particular championing those from ethnic minority backgrounds to look to managerial roles. When she retired, she began to work as a volunteer in Holloway and Pentonville prisons, helping organise family days, when children could play with their imprisoned parents. Maggie is survived by me, her two children and four grandsons.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/jul/04/maggie-ross-obituary,Education,2024-07-04T15:22:39Z,2
education/article/2024/jun/14/jenga-before-lessons-dodgeball-after-verdict-12-hour-school-day,"Jenga, dodgeball and no phones: a London school’s radical 12-hour day","Two months ago a radical experiment in one London state school hit the headlines. All Saints Catholic College announced it was piloting a 12-hour school day in what was reported as a bold attempt to break students’ phone addictions. From 7am to 7pm on Monday to Thursday the youngest pupils, in years 7 and 8, could stay in school. For £10 a week, they would be served a cooked breakfast and “family” dinner, and offered activities from drama to ceramics and sports. The only catch: their phones had to remain in their bags, switched off, for the entire 12 hours. No peeking. When the Guardian arrives at the school at 7am one Tuesday morning, headteacher Andrew O’Neill has already arrived on his racing bike and changed into a smart blue suit. He’s keen to show us how the project works, and to emphasise that it is not just about cracking phone addiction, but “giving children their childhood back”. Phones have been at the heart of so many recent problems in the 900-pupil school, he says, including sexting, bullying and online extortion. We cross the playground to a dance studio which has been turned into a breakfast buffet for the “7-7” children, offering eggs and hash browns to hungry 11- to 13-year-olds, who can then play Jenga or Uno until the school day proper begins at 8.30am. Serenity, 12, is one of 117 pupils signed up to the voluntary 12-hour school day – somewhat reluctantly, complaining to her mother that it would be “too long” and “like a job”. But being parted from her phone is actually OK, she insists. “Even though you’re not on your phone, you still get to do fun activities that you enjoy.” She is well aware of the downsides of phones for children her age. “It’s bad for your mental health,” she says. “Depending on what you watch, some things aren’t safe for younger children … Or you’re comparing yourself with others, and it’s not really nice, because you don’t feel good about yourself.” It was when All Saints reopened fully after Covid that O’Neill noticed children were avoiding eye contact and struggled with holding conversations: “We started to see some issues creeping in – children not really having quite the same sense of belonging or desire to be part of bigger groups, and a little bit more isolationism and apathy.” The 12-hour day idea emerged as a remedy to “reconnect young people to school” and to reframe school as a place not just for learning but also fun. Concerned at how many pupils would leave school, turn on their phones and stare at the screen until bedtime (or beyond), O’Neill wanted to give them a chance to socialise and play together in person. “With the way society is at the minute, and phones is just one part of this, there is a sort of media culture where we try to turn early teens, pre-teens, into adults, way before they’re ready. And they want to become adults way before they’re ready, unless you create an environment where you just allow them to remain being children,” he says. Despite its location among the multimillion-pound white stucco mansions of Ladbroke Grove, All Saints serves a community of high deprivation. Grenfell Tower is visible from the top floor and 50% of pupils qualify for “pupil premium”. A quarter have some sort of special educational need, and 10% have an “education healthcare plan” (ECHP). With this cohort comes extra money, £20,000 of which has been used to fund the 10-week pilot project, paying for the extra meals and staff overtime. When the normal school day ends at 3.15pm, the extended provision begins again. First there is an hour of homework – something the children insist they appreciate the most, because it gets it out of the way. “Work hard, play hard,” deadpans Alex, 11, who got his first phone at the age of five. Then comes the fun bit: sports or art. We join a pottery class, where children are painting clay pots. Zara, 11, insists the 12-hour day isn’t a drag: “It’s not like I’m doing more lessons for more hours. It’s like I’m doing more activities, getting dinner and I’m getting my homework done, for only £10 a week.” Louisa Tice, a trainee teacher who is running rounders, dodgeball and football sessions, thinks the 7-7 programme is helping the pupils improve their social skills. “This generation have become very socially anxious,” she says. Children know phones are part of that, she thinks, and so aren’t actually annoyed at being parted from them for 12 hours. “We are giving them something better.” Some of the older pupils wish they, too, could do 7-7, nostalgic for the after-school clubs they attended at primary school. “I used to love extracurriculum clubs. I was in football. I used to do dance,” says Kyra, 16. Now, when she gets home after school, “it’s just me, myself and my phone.” Most teenagers know they spend too much time on their phones – but so, they point out, do adults. “There’s lots of adults who still don’t know what’s right and wrong when using a phone and don’t hold themselves accountable for their actions online,” says 15-year-old Bella. An important aspect of 7-7 is the family dinner, which not only gives pupils a hot meal they might miss at home, but also gets them used to chatting over the dinner table instead of looking down at a phone. When the Guardian visits, there is cheesy bolognese or chickpea and kale biryani, with pupils serving each other glasses of squash as they talk excitedly about their day. The pilot project finishes at the end of June. O’Neill hopes to reprise it again in the new school year, but probably not in winter, when it goes dark at 4pm and the weather is too poor for outdoor sports. A full evaluation will follow but, in the first six weeks, there was a 16% rise in 7-7 children getting merit stars, as well as a 12% drop in detentions for not doing their homework. Among pupils who previously had the worst homework records, the drop was 60%. It’s hard to track screen time, but students say they are spending less time glued to their phones. Before 7-7, phones filled the after-school “vacuum”, says O’Neill: “We’re building better habits for them: the habit of doing homework, the habit of actually playing with their friends … and then a habit of actually engaging with their friends in a conversation over a meal.” He believes the experiment is fundamentally changing the experience of school: “It’s about creating that sense of belonging and a reconnection back into the common good.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/jun/14/jenga-before-lessons-dodgeball-after-verdict-12-hour-school-day,Education,2024-06-14T07:02:25Z,2
education/2025/oct/31/soaring-costs-trigger-calls-to-address-transport-for-send-pupils-in-england,Soaring costs trigger calls to address transport for Send pupils in England,"Home-to-school transport costs in England have risen to £2.3bn a year, as increasing numbers of children with special educational needs and disabilities travel farther afield to schools that can meet their requirements, according to a report. More than half a million children and young people up to the age of 25 now get council-funded transport from their home to school or college, triggering a £415m overspend by local authorities last year, the National Audit Office (NAO) found. Of the 470,000 children under 16 who benefit, about 40% (180,000) have special educational needs and disabilities (Send), but councils spend approximately five times more on transport for Send pupils than others (£8,116 v £1,526), as they often have to travel further in single-occupancy taxis, contributing to a 70% real-terms increase in spending overall in the past eight years. Home-to-school transport is one of the fastest growing areas of local authority spending, according to the NAO, at a time when councils are struggling with growing deficits due to the sharp rise in the number of children and young people being assessed as needing education, health and care plans. The BBC reported this week that Reform UK’s George Finch, who became leader of Warwickshire county council at age 18, wrote to the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, seeking permission to revise the rules around pupil eligibility for free transport to save money. Phillipson said the plans, which could see pupils as young as eight walking up to five miles to school, showed Reform posed a danger to children. The government announced last week it was delaying the publication of its long-awaited white paper detailing plans to overhaul Send provision until next year. In its report on Friday, the NAO urged ministers to address home-to-school transport as part of its Send reforms. Local authorities are required to provide free transport for school-age children who cannot walk to their nearest suitable school due to distance, special educational needs or disabilities, or safety concerns, with extra support for low-income families. Because of the growing bill, however, the NAO said many councils were reducing provision of additional discretionary transport. As well as the increase in Send pupils, expenditure has gone up because of increased transport costs and growing demand due to public transport cuts in rural areas. “Local authorities are making savings to meet their statutory duties, but they are looking to the Department for Education’s upcoming Send reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of home-to-school transport,” said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO. Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, expressed concern that the national conversation about children with Send has become focused on cost. “We have to put the needs of these youngsters first and ensure that the Send system and associated costs are sufficiently funded both now and in the future.” Bill Revans, Send spokesperson for the County Councils Network, said: “Councils in county areas are now spending more on school transport than they are on Sure Start centres, youth services and family services combined. This is unsustainable.” He called for “root and branch reform” of the Send system. “A key element of this should be enabling greater inclusion in mainstream schools so they can better cater for more Send pupils’ needs, allowing them to be taught locally and reducing the reliance on specialist placements whilst cutting transport costs for local authorities.” Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The schools white paper, now delayed to 2026, and forthcoming Send reforms must tackle these unsustainable expenditure rises and ensure that the children and young people who rely on this invaluable service continue to be supported in their access to education.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Work is already under way to make sure more children with Send can achieve and thrive at their local school alongside their peers – including investing £740m to create more specialist school places and increasing access to early support for speech and language needs. “We’ll set out the full schools white paper in the new year, building on the work we’ve already done to create a system that’s rooted in inclusion, where children receive high-quality support early on and at a school close to home.”",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/oct/31/soaring-costs-trigger-calls-to-address-transport-for-send-pupils-in-england,Education,2025-10-31T05:00:18Z,1
education/2025/oct/27/david-peck-obituary,David Peck obituary,"My father, David Peck, who has died aged 90, was principal careers officer (PCO) for Shropshire, and served as president of the Institute of Careers Officers and as chair of the Association of PCOs. A passionate advocate for the profession, he was never afraid to stand up to politicians to further the case for career guidance for people of all ages. In his year as president, 1978-79, David’s capacity for networking and writing won influence with the then employment secretary Jim Prior as well as with decision-makers in local authority associations. In 1974 David set up the new local education authority careers service in Shropshire (following the passing of the Employment and Training Act 1973), at a time of global recession, rising youth unemployment and a need to improve qualifications to drive up quality. He advocated for a chartered and graduate profession and, as lead moderator for the diploma in career guidance, supported the development of those entering the field. His strong sense of ethics often put him one step ahead of the trends, and he advocated for young people in areas of rural deprivation, and women returning to work. Born in Hillsborough, Sheffield, David was the eldest of four children of Dorothy (nee Jobling) and Thomas Peck, a civil servant. He went to Wisewood secondary school and then became a junior clerk in the town clerk’s office, studying for local authority exams as an evening student at the technical college. At 18, he joined the RAF for his national service. He returned to Sheffield and the city council, and also enrolled at Sheffield University as a part-time student, gaining a diploma in public and social administration. He soon began work with the Youth Employment Bureau and also ran a youth club at Hillsborough Trinity Methodist church. In 1959 David married Pat Webster, who had been a school friend of his sister Diane. They moved in 1967 to Lincoln for David to take up the post of principal careers officer there, and six years later the family settled in Shropshire. Three years after his retirement in 1995, he became an associate of the International Centre for Guidance Studies at Derby University, where his wisdom and experience were hugely valued. David’s book, Careers Services: History, Policy and Practice in the United Kingdom (2004), is wide-ranging and was meticulously researched. David was known for his wry sense of humour and being able to conceal his irritation when faced with a lack of understanding of career guidance. In 2018 he and Pat returned to the Sheffield area. While his walks became gradually shorter, he continued to go out daily, enjoying the return of the willow warbler and swift each year and the call of the curlew on the moors. Pat died in 2021.

education/2025/oct/27/adult-education-should-be-for-life-not-just-a-job,"Adult education should be for life, not just a job","Re your editorial on post-16 education (21 October), six months before Labour was swept to power, I wrote in to encourage an incoming government to “create a system of lifelong adult education in what RH Tawney called ‘a broad and generous, humane and liberal spirit’” (Letters, 29 January 2024). Sadly, Labour’s white paper on post-16 education and skills does nothing of the kind. Its focus is entirely on skills for employment. Post-16 education must be “employer focused”, yet this – the mantra of decades past – has been a highway to failure. The proportion of adults in further education is now at its lowest since the 1940s. The decline began in the 1990s, when meeting the needs of employers – rather than on all-round provision for life – became the obsession. After the Treasury’s 2006 Leitch review called for further “strengthening employer voice” in the system, participation went into freefall. The white paper says nothing about education for democracy; community, equality and social inclusion receive hardly a mention. Only universities (not further education) are encouraged to develop “civic plans”. One might have thought that “post-16 education” meant education for adults. But this mixed bag is no radical approach. It is the failed recipe of decades past, with the odd new herb. It has no “broad and generous, humane and liberal spirit”. Tawney and other Labour educationists and politicians of the past must be turning in their graves. John Holford Emeritus Robert Peers professor of adult education, University of Nottingham • It was heartening to read your leader on further education colleges. It is a drumbeat that’s rarely given due prominence in the press. When colleges were taken away from local education authority (LEA) control in 1993, they gained much desired freedom but paid heavily by losing any political voice. MPs gave their attention to universities and local authorities listened to school parents. As an LEA education officer who transferred to be a college manager, I saw how important that political power was to halt the year-on-year cuts to college budgets. We should despair but not be surprised at the burgeoning group of 16- to 24-year-olds not in education, employment or training (Neet), or the lack of opportunities for adults. A light-touch piece of research I did 20 years ago demonstrated clearly that for every £1 spent to help a Neet individual, about £1,000 would be saved by the taxpayer in future costs. Every further education college lecturer can provide a host of examples of Neet individuals successfully integrated into education and work. Please keep beating the drum for them. Iain Strath Great Gransden, Cambridgeshire • It is no surprise that in my 30-plus years of involvement with changing vocational courses, GCSEs and A-levels have never been renamed. I was truly a man of letters (YTS: youth training scheme; CPVE: certificate of pre-vocational education; GNVQ: general national vocational qualification; and T-levels) – all of which have struggled for acceptance. The erosion of further education colleges reflects the entrenched academic superiority that deprives us of the tradespeople and care workers we so badly need. Post-16 options have to include fully funded and respected vocational alternatives for the long term, not the political short term.

education/2025/oct/25/you-just-have-to-laugh-five-teachers-on-dealing-with-six-seven-in-the-classroom,‘You just have to laugh’: five teachers on dealing with ‘six-seven’ in the classroom,"Across the UK, school pupils have been shouting out the words “six-seven” during lessons in the latest meme-based craze to sweep through classrooms. While some teachers have chosen to stoically ignore the trend, others have embraced it. Five teachers explain how they’re coping. ‘I thought I had said something rude’ Back in September, I had been talking to my year 11 tutor group about preparing for their GCSE exams in June. I can’t remember exactly what it was in reference to, but I said something like “ … if you’re working to grades six, seven …” and the whole class burst out laughing. It took me completely by surprise. My first thought was that I’d made an allusion to something rude, or that they’d heard something in my accent that sounded funny. A bit exasperated – but genuinely curious and aware that they weren’t intending to be mean – I got them to explain. To be honest, the explanation they then gave didn’t make much difference – I still had no idea. What might have made it extra funny was the weighing-up gesture I had made while speaking. I have since found out that this often accompanies “six-seven”: I had intended it to help convey the act of me thinking aloud. In order to kill it off I try to mention it as much as I can. Nothing deflates a craze like this more emphatically than an adult trying to join in. James, secondary school teacher, north London ‘If you give oxygen to it, then it becomes an inferno’ Being aware of it helps so that you can avoid just blundering into statements like “well, there were 6, 7 million unemployed people in Germany in 1933”. If the number combination is unavoidable, having a rock-solid school behaviour policy and expectations on student conduct really helps, as you can sanction it as you would any other disruption, but I’ve not really had to do that. Policies are one thing, but if students buy into what the school is doing, they’ll be less distracted by the internet crazes (at least in lesson time). With six-seven, I haven’t lost any lesson time, other than for an occasional eyebrow raise and saying “yes, that’s a number, well done”. If you give oxygen to it, then it becomes an inferno. I treat it in the same way I would treat any other disruption. There was the 9 + 10 = 21 craze a while back, and there will no doubt be another craze after this. It’s what kids do. When I was growing up, it was doing Kevin and Perry impressions (admittedly out of the classroom). Children are unpredictable, and I think it’s an adult’s job to react in a way that redirects them back to the path that will get them where they need to go, which, fingers crossed, is coming out with qualifications rather than a behaviour list a mile long for the use of random numbers. Connor, 39, history teacher, London comprehensive ‘They want to feel a part of a group’ The children use it like a bonding chant in the playground: one says it and the others respond to show they are in the same group. It’s like a call-and-response or a football chant – an agreed language they share. I don’t think it has any particular meaning to them; they just know it’s a thing to say. Whatever the latest craze is, they want to feel part of it. It’s banned in my classroom, though – it’s a warning if they shout it out – just like any other shouting out is. It’s particularly tricky in maths lessons. But my class at year 5 are nine to 10-year-olds, so they’re quite accepting of the rules, whereas I understand that at secondary [school] it may be a different matter. I’ve been a teacher for 15 years, and these crazes last for three or four weeks. This craze will die out soon – they always do, especially once their younger siblings start saying it and it’s no longer cool. Then they’ll be on to the next thing. Jane, early 50s, primary school teacher, north-west England ‘You just have to laugh with them’ I started noticing it in August, while teaching English at a foreign language school. It was mostly boys saying it. I taught ages 12 to 18, and it was prevalent among the younger pupils. I had no idea what it was at the time, but I’m 24 years old and I realised it was just a meme similar to when I was at school. The crazes are constantly changing. “Skibidi toilet” was a popular meme back when I was at my training school, but it didn’t really exist as much in the classroom. Unlike “six-seven”, “skibidi toilet” was never written on the board in class, so students were less able to pick up on it. I just ignore it, or sometimes I will laugh with them if I accidentally say it, trying to empathise with them and understand that it is just pop culture. I think they just want to feel that sense of community and camaraderie. Harriet, 24, English teacher at a foreign language school, southern England ‘Playfully shouting it means I rarely hear it now’ I’ve done the job for 30 years and I’ve seen crazes come in and out of fashion, it’s just one of those things. The first time I heard it when I came back after the summer break, I said: “That’s exactly how many examples you need for the reading paper examples; well done!” That, combined with me playfully shouting it at the students (including hand signals), means I rarely hear it now. The students roll their eyes in an amused way, and you can tell by their faces they are thinking “for god’s sake”. Seeing a teacher old enough to be their grandfather [saying it] has put them off, as it puts the cringe factor up to 11. Paul, 54, secondary school teacher, Cheshire ‘Part of an increasingly globalised repertoire of slang words’ This meme-ification of a brain-rotty statement isn’t anything new. “Sigma”, “skibidi”, “cooked” are all examples of an increasingly globalised repertoire of slang words. The most striking thing for me with regard to “six-seven” is how widespread and globally recognised it is, at least in the anglophone world. At the risk of sounding already teacher-ish, I will say that back in my day, schools had their own local, homegrown slang. The children all end up seeing the same videos on social media, and with the ease of sending them to each other, they blow up – and fast. I think children today are far more globally connected with trends and popular culture. With the advent of short-form video, children are able to whiz through far more information, and access far more meme-able popular culture, than before. Combine that with the vastly popular culture exports of the US, and you end up with a “six-seven” around every corner.

education/2025/oct/24/there-must-be-an-engels-playing-with-my-chart,There must be an Engels (playing with my chart),"The research on which you report (Friedrich Engels ‘took creative liberties’ with descriptions of class divides in Manchester, 21 October) reads like a deliberate attempt to diminish the nature and extent of class differences that Engels observed and wrote about. There clearly were areas of the inner city marked by extreme residential segregation, such as Little Ireland, where Engels’ companion Mary Burns lived and showed him around and informed his book. You report that the study says that “in Manchester’s ‘slums’, more than 10% of the population was from the better-off … classes”. In Moss Side and Hulme in the 1970s and 80s there were some professional people living there whom I knew, but the overwhelming majority of inhabitants were working class, and many of them impoverished and discriminated against. To suggest class was not that important is surely to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Prof Ralph Darlington Manchester • Emily Chung has used modern historical research methods to suggest that Friedrich Engels’ 1844 study of the Manchester working class was as much polemic as social investigation. The same might be said of Henry Mayhew’s journalistic investigations of the London working class from 1849. Chung notes that while middle-class and working-class housing was not as differentiated as Engels suggested in reality, while the middle class went to church, the working classes went to the pub. Here Engels, and his Irish proletarian partner Lizzie Burns, broke the mould. They might be found drinking Manchester beer in the Thatched House, Market Street, a pub knocked down for the Arndale Centre. But Engels as a Manchester businessman also drank German pilsner in the Albert Club and Schiller-Anstalt Club.

education/2025/sep/11/oxford-union-condemns-president-elects-reported-comments-on-charlie-kirk-shooting,Oxford Union condemns president-elect’s reported comments on Charlie Kirk shooting,"The Oxford Union has “unequivocally” condemned comments apparently made by its president-elect about the fatal shooting of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk in the US. Kirk, 31, was killed at a Utah Valley University show on Wednesday in what authorities have called a political assassination. George Abaraonye, who became president-elect of the debating society after a vote in June, posted comments in a WhatsApp group after his death, according to the Daily Telegraph. One message was reported to have said “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s fucking go”, while another thought to have been posted on Abaraonye’s Instagram account read “Charlie Kirk got shot loool”. In a statement on Thursday, the Oxford Union criticised the student’s comments and said it “firmly opposes all forms of political violence and strongly stands by our commitment to free speech and considerate debate”. “The Oxford Union would like to unequivocally condemn the reported words and sentiments expressed by its president-elect, George Abaraonye, with regards to the passing of Charlie Kirk,” the society wrote on X. “His reported views do not represent the Oxford Union’s current leadership or committee’s view. “The current administration has, under president Moosa Harraj, no association with and is entirely independent from Mr Abaraonye’s administration.” The statement added: “We would like to reiterate that our condolences lie with Charlie Kirk’s family, especially his wife and young children, who are enduring such terrible grief.” In response, Abaraonye said he had “reacted impulsively” to the news of Kirk’s shooting, and that the comments were “quickly deleted” after news emerged of his death. “Those words did not reflect my values,” Abaraonye added. “Nobody deserves to be the victim of political violence … I extend my condolences to his family and loved ones. “At the same time, my reaction was shaped by the context of Mr Kirk’s own rhetoric – words that often dismissed or mocked the suffering of others. He described the deaths of American children from school shootings as an acceptable ‘cost’ of protecting gun rights. He justified the killing of civilians in Gaza, including women and children, by blaming them collectively for Hamas. He called for the retraction of the Civil Rights Act, and repeatedly spread harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ and trans communities. These were horrific and dehumanising statements.” Kirk and Abaraonye had met during a debate on toxic masculinity held by the Oxford Union in May, the Telegraph reported. Donald Trump, the US president, paid tribute to Kirk as a “martyr for truth and freedom” after the shooting.",education,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/11/oxford-union-condemns-president-elects-reported-comments-on-charlie-kirk-shooting,Education,2025-09-11T21:18:30Z,1
sport/2025/aug/27/afl-bisexual-former-player-mitch-brown-first-lgbtq-man-history,Former West Coast player Mitch Brown becomes first AFL player to come out as bisexual,"Mitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen. The 36-year-old played 94 matches for West Coast in a career that ended in 2016. He identifies as a bisexual man and is in a long-term relationship with a woman. Brown said it would have been difficult had he spoken publicly during his playing career, but was motivated to help change the culture within the sport. “Maybe a second person [comes out], and then the third…,” he told The Daily Aus. “You may be playing with someone who’s in the queer community. Empathy is powerful.” Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. But suspensions have been unable to address the root causes of the game’s struggle to accept diversity among its players. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown said. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter The news was widely welcomed on social media. In addition to messages from fans and supporters, the AFL Players’ Association described the post as “powerful” and the GWS Giants’ account responded with a heart emoji. Pride Cup CEO Hayley Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+ communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “To be honest, I did not think I would ever see the day when either an ex or current AFL men’s player would come out,” she said. “I felt like we were so far away from this, which is really, really exciting, that someone has done it. It shouldn’t take courage to tell the world who you are, but it is extremely courageous from Mitch. “In the light of what the community went through last week, I thought that it’s even more brave that he decided to do it around this time and to speak up about his experiences.” Brown grew up in Ballarat and was drafted into the AFL with pick 16 in 2006. The defender debuted the following year and spent a decade in the competition before playing his final game at age 27, an elimination final against the Western Bulldogs. “I got to the end of my career and I was asked to play on for a couple more years, and I was over it. I was done,” he said. “I craved talking to someone and not being judged. I craved the ability to choose who I wanted to be around, rather than to fit into a team.” He said he had “buried” questions about his own sexuality due to the “hyper-masculine” environment, and that slurs were so constant they “just became part of the normal conversation”. “There have been so many times in my life I’ve seen things or heard things and not said anything … in fear of people thinking I was gay or bisexual.” Brown said he empathises with those currently playing, and it is easier for him as a past player to speak up. “I don’t have to run out there at the MCG in front of 80,000 fans next week … and fear the comments being thrown at me.” Dr Erik Denison, behavioural scientist with Monash faculty of arts, said the way in which Brown came out – voicing criticism of the homophobic environment he has experienced – could be a watershed moment. “What’s different here with Mitch coming out is that he is actually talking about the problems in his sport,” Denison said. “He’s talking openly about the homophobic environment being a factor in him deciding to retire from the game. We haven’t heard that kind of direct criticism before from other players who have come out, including in rugby union and also football in Australia, and so this is an important turning point. “I’m hopeful this could mean that Mitch’s story might have a bigger impact than other players who’ve come out, because he’s a respected AFL player, an insider, talking about the problems in the game. He isn’t an outsider. He’s one of the boys, which means his words will have an impact on those within the game.” AFL CEO Andrew Dillon acknowledged Brown’s courage in sharing his story and how important the moment was for the game. “Today is a step forward, and building on Mitch’s story we hope that others feel encouraged to be their authentic selves and share their own journeys, and that these stories are met with support from teammates, clubs and the wider football community,” Dillon said in a statement. “The AFL will continue to partner with our clubs, our Pride and Allies groups and the LGBTQI+ community to drive and celebrate inclusion across both our AFL and AFLW competitions. “Together, our commitment is to keep making football an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone to thrive — and that work never stops.” In contrast to the men’s game, the AFLW is a diverse competition which champions its many LGBTQ+ players and the community.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/27/afl-bisexual-former-player-mitch-brown-first-lgbtq-man-history,Sport,2025-08-27T02:51:54Z,9
sport/2025/aug/07/the-nhl-preached-inclusion-so-why-has-it-got-into-bed-with-donald-trump,The NHL preached inclusion. So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?,"“Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far – diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued. Last week, Bettman was named alongside NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk and various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports council. The council will be responsible for – among other things – playing an “important role in restoring tradition to college athletics, including … keeping men out of women’s sports.” Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it. This is not the first time Bettman has given mixed messages around social issues. In 2023, for example, the NHL tried to host a career fair aimed at recruiting a more diverse workforce (its inclusivity report noted that the league’s employees were roughly 84% white and 93% straight). The event, attached to that year’s All Star Game in Florida, quickly caught the attention of the governor’s office, which accused the NHL of discrimination – against white people. The league cancelled the career fair. A few weeks later, the NHL again had the opportunity to stand for its diversity values when a handful of players refused to wear their team’s Pride-themed warmup jerseys. Instead, the NHL retreated meekly, encouraging “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues.” That June – Pride month, no less – Bettman cancelled the Pride jerseys altogether, calling the furor around them “a distraction” from the intended message. One wonders what he will call his own foray directly into the culture wars or, for that matter, how the NHL may characterize this particular moment of self-expression from the commissioner. It’s likely that Bettman’s participation in Trump’s sports council will fall into the “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues” category the league talked about during the Pride jerseys fiasco. But seeing as Trump seems fixated on getting trans women out of college sports – even though there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes in college sports, according to the president of the NCAA – this feels like a very specific kind of perspective on a cultural issue, doesn’t it? What’s so aggravating about repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from the NHL under the guise of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these views are all morally equivalent when they’re not. Sure, the players who refused to wear a Pride-themed jersey can’t be forced to wear them, but it’s not like it was simply a fashion choice. Fundamentally, those players made that decision based on a worldview that refuses to accept LGBTQ+ people, including their fellow hockey players, as being equal to them and everyone else. It’s not the jerseys that were the problem – but they did a great job highlighting it. Earlier this spring, Harrison Browne, the first transgender player in professional hockey, wrote that while in the NCAA, he was offered the option to have his own locker room and change his pronouns on the roster. “Looking back, I realize how important it is for trans and non-binary student athletes to have those options, whether or not they take them,” Browne wrote in The Walrus. “These choices provide a baseline of institutional acceptance and acknowledgment for gender-diverse athletes at all levels.” On Monday, Browne told the Guardian via email that “to see [Bettman, Gretzky, and Tkachuk] get behind an administration that is targeting marginalized communities, especially trans people in sports, is deeply disturbing and a huge step backwards in making hockey a more inclusive sport.” And going backwards really isn’t Bettman’s thing, or it never used to be. When he accepted his job as commissioner in 1992, he told a room full of reporters that “the way a league performs well is by making its product as attractive as it can to the greatest number of fans.” He believed in growth, in other words – even up until 2022. What he risks now is stagnation, regression even. On that same day in 1992, Bettman said that he wanted to make hockey, a sport that at the time was seen as violent and retrograde, more “user-friendly.” And he acknowledged that to do it, he’d need to push some of the older owners into the future. “It may be that we are going to head in new, progressive directions that will make sense to every one immediately,” Bettman said. “For some, it may take a little more time.” Maybe the diversity and inclusion stuff doesn’t totally make sense to Bettman in 2025 – other North American sports have decided that they don’t have the stomach to fight the culture wars under Trump either, and NFL commission Roger Goodell is also on the White House sports council. But Bettman should give the league’s diversity policies time to grow, rather than deliberately reversing course, hurting hockey’s players and fans, and ultimately jeopardising the future success of the sport for everyone. If that’s too much to ask, at the very least, if he’s invited to join a club created by a hostile and retrograde president, he should by now have the smarts to just say no.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/07/the-nhl-preached-inclusion-so-why-has-it-got-into-bed-with-donald-trump,Sport,2025-08-07T09:00:29Z,8
sport/2025/sep/05/inclusive-brighton-is-perfect-venue-for-world-cups-sell-out-party-weekend,Inclusive Brighton is perfect venue for World Cup’s sell-out party weekend,"There will be more attention on Villa Park where England play Andorra and more celebrities at Monza for the Italian Grand Prix, but it’s long odds you’ll find a better party in any corner of world sport than the one being thrown in Brighton this weekend. That’s not because of the fanzones, free concerts, and fireworks, but who’s coming. These dates have been ringed ever since the fixture list was released. Everyone who’s anyone in a sport where everyone is someone seems to be planning to make a big weekend of it. England play Australia on Saturday, New Zealand play Ireland on Sunday. Both matches are sold out. “An international at Twickenham is more than a mere spectacle,” Alec Waugh once wrote, “it is a gathering of the clan.” It’s true in Brighton, too, although it will be a very different sort of crowd from the one who used to fill the West Stand in Waugh’s day. Last time the Rugby World Cup went to the city they made a movie about how it all worked out. Karne Hesketh scored in the corner in the final minute, Japan beat South Africa 34-32, and before you knew it the team were up on the big screen in a film called The Brighton Miracle. In a particularly inspired bit of casting, the head coach, Eddie Jones, was played by Temuera Morrison, best known for portraying a cold-blooded bounty hunter in the Star Wars movies. This time, the movie has come before the match. World Rugby is releasing a short film called Where We Belong, directed by the duo Pip + Lib, emphasising rugby’s inclusivity. It is being launched this weekend. “Obviously we’ve seen that players in this tournament have been able to bring across their personalities, because they have that freedom of expression,” says the tournament director, Sarah Massey. “But right from the very beginning we wanted to achieve something a bit deeper, we wanted to make sure we could use this tournament as a platform for all the people, especially women and other under-represented groups, who hadn’t typically seen themselves reflected in the industry.” The executive team is all-female. So are the artists who created the opening TV credits, the DJs, and the groundstaff at the final. It sounds like the sort of talk every sports executive loves to use. The difference is that it’s actually an authentic reflection of the way women’s rugby is. Where We Belong shows a slice of life in three women’s teams and the trailer alone is enough to show that the film-makers caught something about the sport. Pip + Lib have worked with the Lionesses before, but this was their first experience in women’s rugby. “I went into it thinking that there would be a real type that’s interested in rugby,” says Lib. “My perception of it was that it was all very ‘private school’, you know, they’re the ones who have the pitches, and all the options at PE, but actually there are so many different types of girls from different types of backgrounds who love it. And it gives them so much.” “We did a load of casting, so we met a lot of girls,” says Pip. “There was a good handful of very shy girls who didn’t even really want to look at you, like young, awkward teenagers. But then they’re on the pitch and they were just like a completely different person. And that was very cool.” When they are working in football, the girls all want to show off how many keepy-uppies they can do. “But the rugby girls it’s very much like they want to show off their power, their strength, their aggression.” They met one girl who, they suspected, had a hard home life, “and she was like, ‘I come here because I need it. I need this.’ I don’t think we’ve ever heard any girls talk that passionately about a sport.” It’s the nature of a rugby team that it ought to be one place where anyone who wants to play can belong. The irony is that the macho culture of the men’s game made so many people feel so alienated from the sport for so long. It’s only 15 years since Gareth Thomas was so torn about whether or not he could come out that he contemplated killing himself. The women’s game has always been a long way ahead of the men’s on LGBTQ+ representation. “I feel there’s a way in which women’s rugby is kind of inherently queer,” says Lib. “Society has a model of how to be a woman. Being a rugby player actually celebrates all the parts that society doesn’t, necessarily. If you’re bigger, there’s a place for you, if you’re wider, there’s a place for you, if you’re short, there’s a place for you. It’s a space where difference is accepted. And there is queerness about that.” “Obviously the stereotype is just that you’re a lesbian,” said England prop Hannah Botterman on her BBC podcast, Barely Rugby. Botterman is. As she says herself: “I am the stereotypical women’s rugby player.” At a time when every sport’s organisation wants to rainbow-wash its reputation, women’s rugby stands out because its attitude to inclusivity is entirely authentic. No one in it gives a damn where you are on the rainbow spectrum. Some of the most entertaining content produced during this tournament has come from the Kiwi reporter Alice Soper and her partner, who have been putting out videos on how queer each team are (they do it without outing any of the players). OutSports reported that there were more than 50. Soper reckons that’s an underestimate, and the number is above 150. When she ranked the teams by how many queer players they have, she got video messages from players on the Brazilian and US teams demanding a recount. “We know that the USA belongs on that podium, we’re queer and we’re here,” joked the US prop Charli Jacoby. “But not everyone,” she adds, deadpan. “There are some straight sisters.”",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/inclusive-brighton-is-perfect-venue-for-world-cups-sell-out-party-weekend,Sport,2025-09-05T19:00:30Z,5
sport/2025/aug/12/ufc-landed-a-77bn-deal-with-paramount-but-is-dana-whites-trump-bond-a-liability,UFC landed a $7.7bn deal with Paramount. But is Dana White’s Trump bond a liability?,"Forget for a moment the stereotype that MMA athletes and their fans are All-American bar fighters. The MMA community is far more diverse and far more cerebral than the casual onlooker realizes. Has Dana White forgotten that? The UFC president has long sought to expand the sport’s appeal to as many demographics as possible. But in the past few years, he has bet big on a tight affiliation with Donald Trump, who has been perfectly content to revel in the adulation of one segment of the population while heaping scorn upon all others. White has campaigned for Trump, welcomed him to several UFC events and hasn’t immediately smacked down the notion of holding a UFC card at the White House. On the surface, that might seem logical. MMA culture is intertwined with bro culture, and bros are considered the antithesis of “woke” liberalism. But it’s not that simple. Consider a startling fact: while Maga champions an “America First” ideology, the UFC is a paragon of globalism. Of the 11 reigning UFC champions, only one is American – Kayla Harrison, thriving in an organization White once insisted would exclude women. Both Australia and Georgia (the country) boast twice as many champions as the UFC’s home country. The only belt firmly held by US fighters is the unofficial ‘BMF’ (Baddest Motherfucker) belt. White invented this to reward charismatic fighters who put on great shows. While it’s a clever way to encourage personality and panache, it also seems like a DEI program to ensure US fighters remain prominent in the UFC pantheon. So the UFC roster is more global than ever. But UFC fighters have never fit neatly into categories. This diversity was a hallmark of the reality show that broke the UFC into the mainstream, The Ultimate Fighter. The casts included cerebral chess players, devout Christians and someone who brought a compass to ensure that his bed would face north, and another who fled the show to reassure his girlfriend that rumors she saw online weren’t true. And the UFC evolved in ways that might be considered “progressive.” Cain Velasquez didn’t lose any noticeable fan support in 2010 when he sported a “Brown Pride” tattoo across his chest and admitted that his father had immigrated illegally. (Velasquez has since been sentenced to prison for issues unrelated to immigration.) After opposing the idea of female fighters for many years, White threw open the octagon door to Ronda Rousey in a 2013 bout against Liz Carmouche, who was openly gay. White strongly supported Carmouche and even gave an impassioned plea to legalize gay marriage wherever it wasn’t already recognized – a position he stated well before a series of landmark US supreme court decisions upheld that right. Four years later, UFC fighter Jessica Andrade proposed to her girlfriend in her postfight interview in the octagon. While the UFC sold Pride Month gear and gave proceeds to an LGBTQIA+ organization in Nevada, outspoken Trump supporter Colby Covington emerged as one of the sport’s biggest villains. Still, the UFC’s primary demographic of young adult men proved to be a decisive force for Trump’s return to the presidency. This group overlaps significantly with the audience for UFC commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, and Rogan – who felt ostracized by the left after touting scientifically unsound Covid treatments – endorsed Trump last year. But that was November. Fast forward to this summer, and this demographic has veered sharply against Trump. Rogan himself has broken with the president over tariffs, deportations and the Epstein files. Last month, Rogan told podcast guest James Talarico, a Texas Democrat, that he should run for the White House. There’s a case to be made that if the Kamala Harris campaign had managed to get her on Rogan’s podcast last fall, we would have a different president today. Such changes shouldn’t be a surprise. Rogan himself is always on the lookout for new ideas – if anything, he’s a little too receptive to some schools of thought and doesn’t push back or check facts. While older Americans are prone to adopting a party and sticking with it come hell or high water, Gen Z is fiercely independent politically. They’re also more diverse than previous generations, more likely to be non-white, LGBTQ+ or any other group that may feel aggrieved by Trump’s actions since reclaiming the presidency. Younger generations are also much more receptive to socialism than prior ones – after all, young men made enough of a fuss over Bernie Sanders to warrant the term “Bernie Bros.” So Maga’s place in “bro culture” – and those who are MMA fans – is by no means secure. And one day, Donald Trump will be out of office. We’ve already seen that US conservatives are eager to abandon one trend for another. Today’s Maga supporters had a decidedly different message when the Tea Party reigned supreme. Two decades after calling Democrats “traitors” for opposing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they excommunicated the entire Bush family. Trump’s popularity may well be on the slide too. His approval rating has tanked, and his mutable responses to the Jeffrey Epstein saga have fractured his base. The UFC may well be losing as many fans as its attracts by aligning itself with Trump. The UFC, meanwhile, is still a strong brand but perhaps not the hot property it was a few years ago. Last week’s Disney earnings report made a brief reference to “lower Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per event.” The fight game tends to be cyclical, driven by big personalities like Rousey, Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, all of whom have either left the sport or gone through a prolonged period of inactivity. It’s tough to imagine current light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev reaching the level of fame of Forrest Griffin, Rampage Jackson or Chuck Liddell. While we can’t really quantify the impact of the Trump lovefest on the UFC’s popularity, the organization clearly can’t afford to alienate the 60% or so of the population that disapproves of Trump’s presidency thus far. Perhaps this is one reason why the UFC has just opted for a new media deal that breaks from their pay-per-view model in order to get wider exposure. “This shift in distribution strategy will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports fans,” said the press release announcing the seven-year, $7.7bn deal. Some fight cards will be on network TV, and others will be free to subscribers of their streaming partner. That streaming partner, though, is Paramount, which has also drawn the ire of many US viewers through a series of moves that appear to be a capitulation to the president’s desire to control the media. First, Paramount settled a lawsuit over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a lawsuit deemed by many legal scholars as rather simple for Paramount to win, at the same time that the media conglomerate sought government approval for a merger. Second, after TV host Stephen Colbert criticized his parent company for settling the suit, Paramount announced that his show will end in 2026, ostensibly for financial reasons even though it is the highest-rated late-night show. (Fox News Channel claims its show Gutfeld! has higher ratings, but it airs earlier than the traditional late-night window that starts at 11.30pm Eastern time.) Still, the decision to move away from the pay-per-view model can only be seen as a sign that the UFC feels the need to make its big tent a bit bigger as it faces the difficult challenge of keeping US fans interested in a sport in which American athletes are far from dominant. Typically, US sports broadcasters gravitate to events in which US athletes are faring well, which is why Olympic coverage focuses far more attention on swimming and snowboarding than, say, table tennis or biathlon. White and Trump were always an odd match. Trump was involved with Affliction, a rival MMA organization of the late 2000s that White fought with the venom of the Trump administration’s attacks on Harvard and the media. Trump has ridiculed veterans, dating back to when he said he didn’t consider John McCain a war hero because he likes “people who weren’t captured’ and continuing with Ice arrests of veterans in his second term and a recent awkward moment in which he turned attention to himself at a ceremony honoring Purple Heart recipients; White and the UFC are staunch supporters of the Wounded Warrior Project and other veterans’ groups. White is an affable philanthropist; Trump used funds from his own foundation on a portrait of himself and his presidential campaign. We probably won’t see White publicly repudiate Trump, a move that wouldn’t sit well with a sizable portion of UFC’s audience. But over the years, White has shrewdly expanded the UFC fanbase, and he would dearly love for his sport to be the biggest in the world. White has already pronounced that his involvement with politics ends with Trump, telling The New Yorker last year that: “I’m never fucking doing this again. I want nothing to do with this shit. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with politics.” White has changed his mind about many things over the years. He brought in Kimbo Slice not long after denigrating his fighting skills. He brought women into the cage. But those moves were driven by popular uprisings, and White is almost always willing to give fans what they want. While much of the country watches in horror as Medicaid is slashed, Gaza’s suffering gets worse by the week, the economy teeters on the brink, and the White House is in crisis mode trying to deflect from the Epstein case, the clamor to make White reassert his position at Trump’s side will surely be muted.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/12/ufc-landed-a-77bn-deal-with-paramount-but-is-dana-whites-trump-bond-a-liability,Sport,2025-08-12T09:00:18Z,4
sport/2025/sep/19/freedom-joy-womens-rugby-world-cup-quirky-quality-rugby-union-england,Freedom and joy: Rugby World Cup’s quirky quality sets it apart from the pack,"I have a friend who rejects the notion of “guilty pleasures”. There is, she argues, plenty of real and justified guilt in the world, without co-opting it to our choice of trash TV or an unkickable penchant for romantasy novels. She’s a helpful touchstone when I hear myself trying to justify the silly superhero film I went to see at the cinema on the basis that it might have carried an underlying anti-fascist message (if you squinted hard enough at the screen). My friend will sigh kindly and then remind me: sometimes it’s OK just to enjoy things. It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer. Ask a football fan if they enjoyed themselves at the match they just paid a decent whack to see, and there’s a better-than-even chance they will tell you no. If it was a close match, they will have been too anxious to have fun; if they lost they will be mourning their defeat. Even if their own side ran rampant, you can find them complaining about the lack of challenge or jeopardy. We are, as fans, especially averse to one-sided games, which can feel anything from a deflationary disappointment to a waste of everybody’s time. This is why the current Women’s Rugby World Cup is such a curious phenomenon. The tournament has been one of largely lopsided scorelines, from the group stages to the quarter-finals. Only five of the 28 fixtures have been decided by fewer than 14 points, and more than half were won by more than 40 – at least six scores. And yet there remains a profound and unanimous pleasure to be had across the entire affair: it’s hard to find anyone that’s watching along and not enjoying it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). Meanwhile the action on the pitch has delivered flair and fascination, even on days when the rain has lashed down until the ball is butter and the scrums steam like suet pudding. The match-ups may be uneven but the power and athleticism on display on all sides of the pitch have been mesmerising. Sure, the host nation’s dominance is a natural mood enhancer. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. That’s only part of the picture, however. It doesn’t encompass the joyful embrace of The Kid, New Zealand’s 18-year-old top try-scorer Braxton Sorensen-McGee (whose daring dashes down the wing could well knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles if the two sides meet). It can’t account for the bipartisan cheer when Spain, 54-3 down against those same Black Ferns, scored an 83rd-minute try. More than a year ago, industry insiders involved in women’s sport were predicting the captivating success of this World Cup, arriving on the back of a Lionesses campaign and in the wake of Ilona Maher’s single-handed social media takeover of rugby union. More than one said privately that 2025 would be the year rugby “flipped” and a women’s event outperformed the Lions tour. The men certainly delivered intense drama and historic scenes as Maro Itoje led the Lions to victory in the second Test. But they didn’t do it to a TV audience of 4.6m. And no one in the team was wearing a cowboy hat or banging on drums from the stands. It’s that quirky, come-as-you-are quality that is this current tournament’s greatest triumph. Even as it has taken its slickly commercialised place in a crammed calendar of global sporting events, this Rugby World Cup still seems fuelled by a radiant and irrepressible delight. Plenty of stadiums work hard to create a party atmosphere but you don’t get the sense that anyone here is forcing or faking it. Not when players are taking up their positions before kick-off still lip-syncing to the music on the PA. Other sports – and more pertinently their investors – will be analysing this fan engagement and wondering how to replicate it. Good luck to them. The core of rugby union’s appeal is its eclecticism and the personalities that beam from the women’s game are one-of-a-kind. There’s the South African No 8 Aseza Hele, nicknamed flower or “Blommie” off the pitch for her sweet nature, who struggles even to recognise herself when she’s sandbagging the opposition. There’s Abby Dow, the lethal finisher who you’ll find neatly crocheting referees’ whistles in the dugout. This is a sporting sorority that confounds and confuses boringly predictable stereotypes of how a woman looks and behaves – Anne-Marie’s song choice of Psycho at the climax of the opening ceremony could not have been better chosen – while simultaneously wreathing itself in Barbie pink, 90s girl-power nostalgia, make-up tie-ins. There’s a freedom in the way this tournament has joyfully embraced it all and cared not one brass farthing for your opinion. And who would dare to mess with this powerful pack? The Red Roses’ adopted slogan is “for the girls”. It is, of course, a marketing tactic as much as a rallying cry, but it came directly from team conversations and reflects something quite true about the women’s rugby community, that is a place where people are for each other, not against them. Their fast-growing fanbase, many of whom have only discovered the sport in the past couple of years, do not show up to games with the typical baggage: decades of disappointment, crusted-over anger, inherited and inexplicably toxic rivalries. They have found their way to this sport along far less tribal pathways, through body-positive TikTok videos and Ellie Kildunne’s haircare tips. There has been no male gatekeeping here, no trivia questions to establish whether you really belong: everyone is instantly welcome. It may be this is all just a function of where the sport is at developmentally. Growth will, of course, bring change, just as it has for women’s football. Perhaps the gleaming sense of fun will tarnish with time and corporate takeover, and perhaps not. For now, it’s OK to just enjoy things.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/19/freedom-joy-womens-rugby-world-cup-quirky-quality-rugby-union-england,Sport,2025-09-19T07:00:37Z,3
sport/2025/sep/07/usta-trump-censorship-us-open-booing,"The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American","When the dust finally settles in the days after Sunday’s eagerly awaited US Open men’s final, the United States Tennis Association will issue its annual victory-lap press release. It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity and turning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination. But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician – any politician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval. According to internal emails obtained by outlets including PA and Bounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.) This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protester gluing himself to a seat for nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind its US Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation. And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy. Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa May was booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macron was whistled during the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is all but guaranteed a chorus of boos during public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next to the venom reserved for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman from fans. And Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have been given hostile receptions by sports crowds. Somehow the United Kingdom, France and the United States survived those incidents intact. That the USTA thinks Trump must be insulated from reality hints at something darker. It is reminiscent of regimes where the leader’s image must be protected from public ridicule. It shows how much Trump’s first term – and his bullying of cultural institutions – still shapes behavior. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. Now, as Tom Dart wrote before this year’s Super Bowl, he is increasingly accommodated or treated with silence. The Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered, vibrant and exuberantly multicultural, where the crowd is as much a presence as the players on the court. By sanitizing its reaction, the USTA isn’t just shielding Trump. It is stripping the event of its unique character, authenticity and integrity. That irony cuts even deeper because the Open has always been at the forefront of progress. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. It platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion. From a Maga vantage point, of course, it probably looks like the Woke Super Bowl: King’s name on the gates, Gibson’s silhouette over Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus Williams lionized, rainbow-tinged Pride nights, and a governing body trumpeting diversity at every turn. Which, if we’re being honest, may be one reason Trump is showing up in the first place: a 4D chess move with the intent of turning a tennis match into another battleground of grievance. Getting booed by thousands of fans drinking $23 vodka-lemonades won’t exactly be a bad look for his base, especially in a corrupt, disgusting hellhole like New York. Fans will still do what fans do. If they want to boo, they will boo. But millions at home may never see it, thanks to a governing body that has chosen to act less like a guardian of sport and more like a nervous producer of campaign stagecraft. For a sport that prides itself on honesty and clarity – the ball is in or out – it is a shameful retreat.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/07/usta-trump-censorship-us-open-booing,Sport,2025-09-07T12:07:36Z,3
sport/2025/aug/19/male-cheerleaders-nfl-vikings,I played in the NFL. Outrage over male cheerleaders is really about attempts to control masculinity,"Of all the existential threats facing professional football – concussions that erode the minds of players, scandals that rot institutions from within, dwindling youth interest in a sport built on collision and control – who could’ve predicted that what would truly rattle some fans was the sight of two men dancing on the sideline? Earlier this month, the Minnesota Vikings unveiled their newly minted 35-member cheerleading squad with a bold promotional video captioned, “The next generation of cheer has arrived!” It wasn’t just the choreography that caught attention, but the fact that two male performers, Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn, were part of the group. Almost immediately, reactions erupted online, from heartfelt support to calls for a boycott, and even a homophobic slur wielded by a former NFL player whose name deserves no mention in this or any other reputable publication. Amid the storm, the Vikings stood firm. And rightly so. After all, Minnesota is no stranger to innovators who challenge convention. This is the home of Prince, a man who wore high heels, embraced gender ambiguity, and redefined masculinity. In an official statement, the Vikings reminded everyone that male cheerleaders – whose number include former US presidents – are nothing new, not only at the amateur and collegiate levels but also in the NFL itself. As of the 2025 season, at least 11 NFL teams include male cheerleaders on their official squads, the first being the Los Angeles Rams back in 2018, when Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies made history on the sidelines and later performed at the Super Bowl in 2019. The Minnesota Vikings also reminded people that Shiek and Conn earned their spots through the same competitive process as their peers, much like we football players compete and earn our spots on the roster. I was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 2015, and I’ve been in those locker rooms where the pressure to perform as an athlete, teammate and man can feel overwhelming. The one thing that wasn’t on my mind or any other player’s mind was the cheerleaders. Not because they weren’t talented. Not because they didn’t belong. But because during the game, while they performed on the sidelines or at half-time, we were in huddles, making adjustments on the sidelines, giving our all on the field, or processing and schemes in the locker rooms for the next half. Everyone out there has a job to do, and the cheerleaders are no exception. They’re not there for the players. They’re there for the fans. Which means they should reflect all the fans. The people expressing outrage over male cheerleaders on the Vikings aren’t talking about work ethic, talent or dedication. Their complaints are even more baseless than the Monday Morning Quarterbacks – a term created to address those who criticize players with the benefit of hindsight. This isn’t about performance at all. It’s about presence. It’s about the mere existence and visibility of men on NFL cheer squads who don’t conform to the rigid, outdated ideas of masculinity that so many use sport, and football in particular, to defend. What this backlash really reveals is not fear of change, but fear of visibility. The outrage over male cheerleaders isn’t about sports. It’s about control: over masculinity, over image, and over who gets to be seen and celebrated in public spaces or on the global stage of the NFL. It’s the same impulse that drives anti-LBGTQ+ legislation, the same fear that fuels book bans, bathroom bills, and attacks on drag performers. This moment isn’t isolated; it’s part of a broader cultural backlash to liberation. And just as Christian nationalism has long been weaponized to marginalize queer people, so too has sport. Sport is used to draw lines around what’s “American” and “man enough”. But those lines were never drawn for protection; they were drawn for power. The truth is, football isn’t as rugged as society would like us to believe. The power of sport is in its intimacy; its emotional extremity. In the way players and fans alike grieve, cry, pray, dance, and embrace under the lights and flags, and banners. The locker room is one of the few places in American culture where men are allowed to be vulnerable, broken, weep, and to hug in celebration, speak with peers across all cultures and generations, and build themselves up again. When you peel back the helmets and hits, you’ll see what’s always been there: joy, vulnerability, brotherhood, and the undeniable truth that masculinity isn’t fixed, it’s fluid. And that’s not changing. Shiek, Conn, and every male cheerleader across the league aren’t just cheering for a team. They’re cheering for possibility, for the next generation of boys who want to move their bodies with pride, for the kids who don’t see themselves in shoulder pads but still belong in the stadium. Sport isn’t sacred because it resists change. It’s sacred because it brings people together, and the more inclusive that togetherness becomes, the more powerful the game will be.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/19/male-cheerleaders-nfl-vikings,Sport,2025-08-19T10:00:39Z,3
sport/2025/sep/20/rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup-europe-usa-masters-golf-interview,‘My time in the sun’: Rory McIlroy on Ryder Cup hopes and Masters glory,"“I think one of the biggest accomplishments in golf is winning an away Ryder Cup. And that is what we’re going to do at Bethpage.” It was this parting shot that epitomised Rory McIlroy’s 2023 Ryder Cup. Stirred by a Saturday spat with the American caddie Joe LaCava, McIlroy came close to brawling in a car park before returning on day three to lead Europe’s comprehensive victory in Rome. Amid wild celebration, he promised the Ryder Cup would be retained. Exaggerated words or ones to stand by? “I am maybe more confident than I was then,” McIlroy tells me in a quiet corner of the locker room at East Lake, Atlanta. “Obviously I said that in the euphoria of winning the Ryder Cup but I think with everything that has happened since; the way our team is shaping up, Luke agreeing to be the captain again, having the continuity of the team the way it is, the form of the Europeans all of this year but especially leading into the event. “If I compare it to the last two away Ryder Cups that I have played, I would say we are in a way better spot. I still believe we are the underdogs but I feel more confident than I was in 2016 and 2021 that we can pull it off.” McIlroy returns to the Ryder Cup arena as the sixth man in history to complete a career grand slam, his already exalted status elevated further. Events at the Masters in April will serve as the reference point for this and so many other golfing years, regardless of whether or not Luke Donald and co can topple Keegan Bradley’s USA. McIlroy’s lovability was as noteworthy as the fact he ticked off his final major after a wait of more than a decade. Those words from Italy, though, prove McIlroy had Bethpage on his mind long before Augusta National was conquered. “When we won at Medinah in 2012 I didn’t appreciate what it meant,” says McIlroy. “It was only my second Ryder Cup and my first away and I think I didn’t appreciate the magnitude of what was happening, especially the way it played out that Sunday afternoon. It is a bit of a distant memory. I would love that feeling again. I can take myself back there, absolutely, and the feelings I had were great, amazing. I just don’t think I really appreciated how difficult that was to do.” There is a broader theory the Ryder Cup would benefit from even the occasional away success. “Absolutely it would,” McIlroy nods. “It’s not that it needs any life breathed into the event but it would add an extra dimension. One of the really intriguing things about the Ryder Cup now is; what team is going to blink first? It’s almost like holds of serve, who is going to break serve? When the Americans came to Rome, it had been 30 years since they won away.” McIlroy could have faced Patrick Cantlay, for whom LaCava caddies, in match three on that Ryder Cup Sunday. After conversation with Donald, McIlroy decided it would be better to remove himself from that situation. McIlroy instead saw off Sam Burns in match four. “Historically I have gone third and they knew that,” McIlroy says. “I think it was better for me, better for the team, better for all of us. On Sunday you don’t care who you win your point against.” In 2016 at Hazeltine, McIlroy was at the centre of drama involving US fans and Patrick Reed. When Rome and the vociferous nature of New York fans is added to the mix, it is reasonable to ponder what may transpire next. The tribal nature of a non-tribal sport triggers strange things. “It is not planned,” McIlroy insists. “It is not as if any of this is premeditated. “I think it’s inevitable something is going to happen in New York. It might not involve me but it is inevitable that something will happen, whether like in Rome last time or something else. “I just think when you go into that environment and you are there for five or six days and the crowd are on you for eight hours, so many days in a row … it is inevitable it will get to someone or get to us as a group at some point. We are just going to have to do a really good job of managing that, having each other’s backs and protecting each other.” McIlroy does not so much roll his eyes as laugh when Bryson DeChambeau’s approach is raised. DeChambeau crumbled as McIlroy triumphed at Augusta. Somewhat curiously, then, the American intends to “chirp in the ear” of McIlroy at Bethpage. The response is a withering one. “I think the only way he gets attention is by mentioning other people,” says McIlroy. “That is basically what I think of that. To get attention he will mention me or Scottie [Scheffler] or others.” The venue for this interview serves as an endearing reminder of McIlroy’s march into the pantheon of greats. Seven years ago in this very locker room McIlroy shared his thoughts with me as Tiger Woods walked past us. Woods was to win that week in Atlanta amid rapturous scenes topped only by his Masters glory the following spring. McIlroy was still waiting, waiting, waiting for the Green Jacket. Back in precisely the same spot in 2025 McIlroy signs Masters flags as we talk and Woods is no longer a competitive element. When McIlroy reached his holy grail at the Masters this year external sentiment turned towards what he may do next. This was unfair, of course, and grated with the man himself. McIlroy adds: “People started to go on about the calendar slam. I was like, ‘Let me just enjoy this one.’ “I think that is what people want from sportspeople. They don’t want sportspeople to say they are satisfied because that gives off the idea that you are not putting 100% into what you are doing, which we all are. When you have had a goal for so long and you achieve it, it just takes a little time to reset some goals.” This took McIlroy into fascinating psychological territory. On one hand, he could gladly have taken months away from the game. On the other, there was a natural instinct to rededicate himself to his craft. Even when the Ryder Cup was the prominent thing in the 36-year-old’s mind, he rolled in a 30ft birdie putt to secure a playoff spot at an Irish Open he was to eventually win. “When you have that feeling, when you win that thing, it is almost like all the other stuff doesn’t matter in a way,” McIlroy says. “Not that it actually doesn’t. It is a double edged sword. “I have realised over the past few years that when all is said and done, people aren’t going to remember how much money I won. What they are going to remember is how many majors I won. So getting up for those? Not a concern at all. It’s the week-in, week-out stuff that I have found a bit of a struggle at times. The majors and the Ryder Cup are the five things in golf that at this point really matter to me. “It was unbelievable to win the Masters with [caddie and best friend] Harry [Diamond]. I would love to win an Open with Harry. I would love to get that US Open that we have been so close to. It’s sometimes not just about me, it is about the other people who have been on the journey too.” McIlroy, whose home is in Florida, always looks content in Europe. There is a “reminiscent” feeling for him there that seems to feed into his Ryder Cup desires. “I think about my early days as a pro,” he says. “It brings me back to a simpler time in life where I was just so happy to travel the world and play golf. I enjoy playing in front of home crowds, which I struggled with earlier in my career. These people have watched me grow up. You can definitely disconnect with the wider golf world. It maybe doesn’t feel all encompassing. I find it easier to detach from every day tour life.” Being Rory McIlroy. It is a concept nobody else can relate to, although so many try. Offer the man himself a little peace and quiet and he might just snap your hand off. “It is a struggle for me to love the position I am in all the time,” he admits. “There are times when I would like to just breeze through life and not get the attention I do but I understand that with what I have done in the game, that is just part of it. There are times that I yearn for a little anonymity and having a quieter life. That will happen one day. This is my time in the sun. In 10 years it won’t be and that is my time to enjoy that part of it.” Enjoy him while he lasts.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/20/rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup-europe-usa-masters-golf-interview,Sport,2025-09-20T07:00:07Z,2
sport/2025/sep/08/trumps-strongman-image-got-boos-at-the-us-open-and-perhaps-that-was-the-point,"Trump’s strongman image got boos at the US Open, and perhaps that was the point","It was just the authoritarian image Donald Trump hoped to project at the US Open: the president himself, looming from Arthur Ashe Stadium’s giant screens like Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Gate, as he stood at attention for the national anthem. But there was no denying that, while the picture was there, the sound clashed. The burst of cheers that went up for his stiff salute on Sunday was quickly drowned out by a chorus of boos made louder from the Ashe roof being closed for rain – perhaps fitting given that many fans had been left to stand in the wet and endure the long security lines that resulted from his attendance. In that awkward five-second moment, as the Stars and Stripes was unfurled on center court, the president smirked at the negative reaction. It surely rang so familiar. Trump’s presence at the US Open men’s final wasn’t just intended as a soft power grab, the kind of routine stunt Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and the other despots he admires pull all the time at sports events – except with recruitment ads for Ice playing across the US. No, Trump’s presence was intended as a distraction. Not a distraction for him; lord knows, he couldn’t care less about the actual match, a fact that was reinforced when Trump left his luxury box seat to step inside and kibitz with a phalanx of suck-ups. No, Trump’s visit was dropped like a flash bang to divert attention from klaxoning recession indicators, rumbling speculation about his health and, naturally, those files about that guy whose name must not be mentioned. If Trump was motivated by a patriotic love for tennis, he would have rocked up a day earlier for the women’s final. But for Trump the prospect of cheering on Jersey girl Amanda Anisimova and her epic comeback story clearly wasn’t juicy enough, much less the idea of actually sharing the spotlight with an American player. So Sunday’s match-up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz was retrofitted for Trump’s calliope Maga stage. Before the tilt Alcaraz, a Spaniard, was asked about playing in front of the president, and stepped right into the trap. “For me, playing in front of him, I don’t want myself to be nervous,” he said, not realizing his words would soon become fodder for Fox and Friends. “I think it’s great for tennis to have the president into the final.” Former presidents have shown that you can appear at a US Open without making it about ego: the Obamas were clearly caught up in supporting a US player when they watched Frances Tiafoe battle Alcaraz in the 2022 semi-final. Bill Clinton was proudly Team USA, too. In 2000, in his final weeks as president, he broke away from the UN Millennium Summit for Pete Sampras’s semi-final against Lleyton Hewitt, joining John McEnroe in the commentary box and signing balls fans lobbed up to him as Secret Service minders looked on and snipers lined the stadium upper deck. Clinton also visited Sampras in the locker room after the victory to Hewitt, continuing the American’s epic quest for a then-record 14th grand slam (which ultimately ended in the next round against Marat Safin). In 2009 Clinton returned and gave the keynote speech for Arthur Ashe’s induction into the US Open’s Court of Champions. He remembered Ashe’s triumphs over segregation, apartheid and his efforts to open his sport up to under-resourced and represented communities. Trump’s presence on Sunday – under the Ashe stadium marquee, on grounds named for gender and LGBTQ+ pioneer Billie Jean King, at a tournament that makes a point of touting its unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion – didn’t just strike a marked contrast. It broke from the markedly lower profiles of past presidents and was over-the-top, even for a sport that regularly hosts royal families. But Trump simply couldn’t pass up the optics. Getting booed by a multicultural east coast crowd that laps up $23 cocktails and $100 caviar-dolloped chicken nuggets without irony is red meat his base would devour. And getting that last laugh would make for satisfying personal revenge, an urgent second-term theme. For 40 years Trump exploited the US Open for clout, calling attention to himself, his luxury box perch and all the bold-faced names who joined him inside. But the New York crowd – the heart of the Open – never cottoned to his faux-gold flash and didn’t hesitate to jeer his big screen pop-ups even then. After the golden escalator ride to kick off his 2015 presidential campaign and the fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreigners, he effectively became spectator non-grata in Flushing. Months later he attended the US Open quarter-final between Venus and Serena Williams and heard more boos as he slunk away with Melania, out of the stadium’s “President’s Gate”. So it meant something for him on Sunday to be back 10 years later, at the same event that was once the crown jewel of CBS and a lead-in for 60 Minutes – two more institutions he is determined to get even with – and back in the hometown he has repeatedly threatened to invade. That is, when he’s not outright declaring war on Chicago. Before Trump’s arrival in his native borough of Queens, as foot soldiers from homeland security and other federal agencies swept the US Open campus, the USTA seemed as if it might do more to accommodate him than Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour – who had reportedly invited the president to the company’s luxury suite in hopes of catching a break on US tariffs imposed on Switzerland. No doubt Trump would have sat in the umpire’s chair if that were an option. The day before the men’s final, news broke that the USTA had issued a memo to broadcasters urging them to avoid showing any dissent against Trump in a craven display of anticipatory obedience that the federation cowardly justified in an 11-word statement. (We thought the former reality show host was supposed to be against unfair editing …) In the moments Trump actually seemed to be paying attention to Sunday’s match, he didn’t really cheer or applaud – which is weird but not surprising. He had made the day about himself, after all. And yet: just when it seemed as if the USTA couldn’t bow down any lower, intentionally or not, it may have pulled off a canny rope-a-dope. Perhaps mindful of the president’s avarice for stolen valor, they set the US Open men’s trophy inside the Rolex box for Trump’s arrival, and then switched it for a doubles cup after the anthem. Breaking with its own edict, the USTA not only showed Trump on the big screen again during the changeover between the first and second sets, it pushed in and held the shot for 20 seconds. The crowd, much larger this time, booed him so long and lustily that it was hard not to be reminded of the harsh reception to Trump at the 2019 World Series. Later on Sunday, the camera cut to noted Trump bugbear Bruce Springsteen – triggering a roar of approval that nearly blew the Ashe roof off. Unlike Fifa at July’s Club World Cup final, the USTA ensured Trump’s Rolex perch became a prison by the end of the match, so Alcaraz could keep up the winner’s tradition of climbing into the crowd to embrace their support team. Trump could only watch, like a kid on punishment seeing his friends play outside, as someone other than him presented the trophy to Alcaraz – because, well, he’s no competition for Ivan Lendl and much better men than Trump have tried taking trophies from the former No 1. After the pomp and circumstance, Trump was gone – back on the road within minutes of match point and in the air not long thereafter, according to the White House pool report. The outsized security presence that turned Sunday’s showcase into an authoritarian spectacle disappeared in his wake, too. For many fans who had suffered through it all, his departure was more cause for celebration. Theodore Roosevelt’s daughter, Alice, once said of her father that “he wants to be the bride at every wedding, the corpse at every funeral, and the baby at every christening.” But the line fits Trump even better. As long as there is attention to be had, you can bet he’ll find a way to make himself the center of it and make sport of self-aggrandizement, regardless of who, or what, he may trample over on his march. • This article was amended on 8 September 2025. We originally identified Alice Roosevelt Longworth’s father as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was, in fact, the daughter of Theodore Roosevelt.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/08/trumps-strongman-image-got-boos-at-the-us-open-and-perhaps-that-was-the-point,Sport,2025-09-08T13:21:19Z,2
sport/2025/sep/04/nfl-2025-season-predictions-super-bowl-football,"NFL 2025 season predictions: will it be Mahomes, Jackson or Allen in the Super Bowl?","This will be the year of … The Micah Parsons revenge tour. Ignore the nonsense coming out of Dallas. Jerry Jones’s claim that Parsons hurt the Cowboys’ run defense is laughable. So is the idea that Parsons’ ego was an issue. NFL history is filled with game-breaking pass-rushers with big egos or, umm, personality quirks. What matters is production, and Parsons is a one-of-a-kind pass-rushing force, capable of detonating the pocket from any alignment. No defender has generated more pressures since Parsons entered the league. With him on the field, the Cowboys had the No 1 defense in the league; when he was off the field, they fell to the second-worst unit in the league. If he needed any extra motivation, the Cowboys booting him on the way out should provide it. OC The running quarterback. Not the quarterback who can get outside the pocket with mobility, but the quarterback who is a legitimate running threat. In pro football history, including the postseason, there have been eight seasons in which a quarterback ran for more than a 1,000 yards in a season. Two of those examples happened in 2024 – Lamar Jackson’s 1,035 yards, and Jayden Daniels’ 1,026. Add in QBs like Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts and Kyler Murray, and the league’s designed quarterback run concepts could be amplified in 2025. DF You do not trade away star edge-rushers in their prime. Jones’s idiotic decision to trade Parsons to Green Bay is set to be franchise-altering for both teams. How it plays out for both sides will be the talk of the league. MJ This is the beginning of the end. First-down technology is here, the chain gang merely standing idle to measure the distance in case their robot overlords fail. In 30 years, when we are watching a AI infused VR simulation of a simulation of the NFL, you will see the folly of all this. Bring back Gene Steratore’s magic paper, before it’s too late! GS An exciting youth movement at quarterback. Six quarterbacks (Daniels, Michael Penix Jr, CJ Stroud, Brock Purdy, Bo Nix and JJ McCarthy) 25 or under will start for teams that are likely to be in playoff contention. Daniels, Stroud, and Purdy could become MVP candidates and lead their teams deep into the postseason. The 25-and-under quarterbacks whose teams are projected to miss the playoffs (Cam Ward, Bryce Young, and Caleb Williams) will also draw national attention. AS Best team that won’t make the playoffs … Daniels is a phenom. But the Commanders are relying on ageing and declining stars to fill out key positions. Despite having a 24-year-old quarterback, the Commanders have the oldest roster since 2012. Maybe pairing that veteran savvy with Daniels’ magic will click. More likely, injuries will bite, the team’s pass-rush will remain sub-par, and they will fall away before January. OC Yes, the Vikings managed a 14-3 regular-season record in the brutal NFC North last year, but they did on the back of Sam Darnold’s unpredictably great season … until it wasn’t. I don’t have the same faith in McCarthy to make that kind of leap, even with a fine head coach, Kevin O’Connell, in his corner. DF Ben Johnson had options, and he chose Chicago, seemingly with a plan to develop Williams. The Bears used their first three picks this year on offensive players. Look for Chicago to start gelling as the season goes on, before the brutal trifecta of the Packers, 49ers, and Lions in the Bears’ final three games sees them fall just short of the postseason. MJ The Rams would walk into the postseason if everything goes their way. However a 37-year-old Matthew Stafford dealing with a herniated disc feels like a case of when, not if, he is replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo. The underpowered backup quarterback will leave his team short. GS Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, leading one of the NFL’s most explosive offenses, will solidify themselves as the league’s top quarterback-wide receiver duo. However, that will not be enough to overcome deficiencies on defense. Al Golden has implemented a new defensive scheme, but without a drastic overhaul, the Bengals will fall short of the playoffs again. AS The most underrated team this year is … Last season ended with a playoff win, but it still felt underwhelming thanks to an offensive line that hung Stroud out to dry. That’s been patched, if not fixed. It’s the defense, though, that will drag the Texans deep into the postseason. They have gamechanging players at all three levels. OC The Bears may not win a ton of games in the loaded NFC North, but Johnson will make the most of Williams in the QB’s second season, and new defensive coordinator Dennis Allen could reform the Monsters of the Midway. Not a playoff team in 2025, but an opponent nobody will want to face. DF The Broncos are probably underdiscussed rather than underrated. Nix was overshadowed by Daniels in the rookie of the year conversation, not to mention Patrick Mahomes in his own division. Sean Payton has been overshadowed by Andy Reid and Jim Harbaugh. Yet Payton reminded everyone that he is a coaching wizard, turning Nix into a force and making the playoffs. With last season’s Defensive Player of the Year, stud corner Patrick Surtain II, leading an elite defense, the Broncos have the tools to make a run. MJ If Murray and Marvin Harrison Jr find some chemistry then the Cardinals could make waves in the playoffs. They should have one of the meanest defensive fronts in the NFL after picking up pass rusher Josh Sweat, so if the offense can step up they have great potential. GS Stroud will be a top 10 quarterback with help from offensive weapons Nico Collins, Nick Chubb, and rookie Jayden Higgins. Defensively, the Texans will cause havoc for opposing quarterbacks, with edge rushers Will Anderson Jr and Danielle Hunter leading the way. AS One bold prediction … Rodgers will end his career on the bench. It’s all kumbaya in Pittsburgh for now. But once the games start, the Rodgers of New York will turn up: skittish in the pocket, inaccurate, unable to create on the fly. If the Steelers stumble, Tomlin will need to pivot to rookie sixth-rounder Will Howard. OC Mike Tomlin’s Steelers tenure will come to an end. The Rodgers experiment looks like a flameout for all kinds of reasons, and while I think it will be more about Tomlin’s own frustration than the franchise’s desire to move on, there’s always that one shocking coaching move ... DF Bill Belichick returns to the NFL … to coach the Dolphins. Mike McDaniel’s struggles from last season look likely to continue as Belichick’s might after a rather inauspicious start with the Tar Heels. Surely a very late career move to sunny Florida makes sense? He certainly knows the division quite well. GS Saquon Barkley will again rush for over 2,000 yards, this time breaking Eric Dickerson’s record of 2,105. Go big or go home, right? The record falls this season as the Eagles continue Barkley’s astronomical workload behind that stellar offensive line. Why tinker with success as long as Barkley’s body can handle it? MJ Shedeur Sanders will end the season as QB 1 for the Browns. Joe Flacco, 40, will serve as the starter for the first month or two. Dillon Gabriel will get an opportunity to start during midseason. But as the losses pile up, the fans and local media will call for Sanders to get a shot. He will be the sole reason the Browns garner national viewership in December. AS Johnny Manziel disaster waiting to happen department The Browns and Saints will have worse records, but the Colts’ season could spiral faster. GM Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen are already on the hot seat, and they have new owners to please. Starting Daniel Jones over Anthony Richardson is understandable, but it is leading the team nowhere. Put me down for Lou Anarumo as interim head coach by Christmas. OC The Cowboys. Without Parsons, Dallas’ defense won’t be a patch on what it was, Dak Prescott is 32 and injury-prone, and though getting receiver George Pickens should improve the passing game, do we want to take odds on the first time he melts down on the field? DF Rodgers and DK Metcalf. Two volatile weirdos in Pittsburgh. What could go wrong? MJ Rodgers and the Steelers are going down in flames. The reasoning behind moving on from Russell Wilson and Justin Fields is sound but bringing in another has-been, only one who is much, much older at 41, is just not going to improve an offense in need of fresh ideas. That said, they will be more fun to watch. GS Jones said that his team would improve defensively by trading Parsons, but it only ensures that the Cowboys’ 30-year Super Bowl drought will continue. AS MVP ... Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs won 14 games and made the Super Bowl last season, but it was a down year for Mahomes. Behind a fragile offensive line, the Chiefs’ offense turned into a three-yard snooze-fest. This season, they’re betting on a pair of debut linemen to solve any concerns on the left side. That’s a big ask, but it’s doable. Around Mahomes, they’ve added much-needed speed with rookie running back Brashard Smith and free-agent cast-off Tyquan Thornton. The Chiefs will be more explosive, Mahomes won’t turn the ball over and he will have the comeback narrative on his side. OC Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens. Last season, Jackson led the NFL in nearly every statistical category that counted, and he was better in the postseason than people think. This year, Jackson snags his third MVP award, and hands the NFL a bit of comeuppance after his snub last time around. DF Jackson has already won two MVPs and enters 2025 feeling snubbed after Allen got the award in 2024, and frustrated with the loss to Allen’s team in the playoffs. Look out, Buffalo. More so, look out NFL. MJ Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders. His ridiculous first season is the type of platform hall of fame careers are built from while Washington have improved the offensive rookie of the year’s working conditions by beefing up the offensive line and receiving crew. Another year working in Kliff Kingsbury’s system allows Daniels to confirm he is a legit superstar. GS This season, Allen and Jackson will remain in the MVP hunt with challenges from Mahomes, Hurts, Daniels, Stroud, Purdy and Jordan Love. But Jackson will prove to be the most dominant, earning his third MVP award. AS The best rookie will be … Abdul Carter, LB, New York Giants. The answer is obviously Travis Hunter. But let’s go with Giants edge-rusher Carter, who will be an immediate game-breaker. Pair him with Dexter Lawrence and Brian Burns, and the Giants quietly have one of the most fearsome pass-rushes in the league. Parsons had 13 sacks as a rookie. Carter could flirt with that number. OC Cam Ward, QB, Tennessee Titans. Last season, Ward was the NCAA’s best quarterback throwing from the pocket, which you don’t expect when you watch his plays outside structure. As was the case for Daniels last season, Ward will find that this transfers very well to the NFL, and he has better targets than one might expect for a guy taking over a 3-14 team. DF Ashton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas Raiders. From vision to explosiveness, Jeanty has all the tools to transform a franchise desperately in need of a lightning bolt. Running backs that go in the top half of the first round usually excel. See Jahmyr Gibbs and Bijan Robinson in 2023. MJ Carter. The hype has him breaking the rookie sack record with 15. If he even gets close to that mark the defensive rookie of the year award is heading to the Giants. Jared Verse only needed 4.5 sacks to take it last season. GS Raiders head coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly are known for emphasizing the run, and Jeanty will be the centerpiece of their offense. Hunter will challenge for rookie of the year, but Jeanty’s high total yards from scrimmage will give him the edge. AS AFC East champ The Patriots are improving, but the Bills will waltz through the division. They still have the most balanced offense in the league and Allen at quarterback. There are plenty of questions about the Bills’ defense, but they won’t be answered until the postseason. OC I have some serious concerns about Buffalo’s defense, and the Patriots should be an upcoming force, but there will be just enough on the offensive side of the ball for the Bills to win their sixth straight AFC East title. DF There is plenty of momentum on offense and reinforcements on the Bills defense. Shockingly, there is ongoing drama brewing with Tyreek Hill in Miami as players opted not to make him a captain. The Jets are trotting out Justin Fields and Drake Maye is still developing for the Pats. No one will touch Buffalo. MJ The Bills are the biggest division lock across the NFL. A lot of maybes hang over the trio attempting to knock one of the most consistent teams off their perch. Allen appears only to be growing stronger, and so does his team’s grip on the division. GS Expect the AFC East to be more competitive this year as the Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots have added significant pieces and are trending in the right direction. Allen and the Bills will win the division for the sixth year in a row, but it won’t be as easy this time around. AS AFC North champ The Ravens. It’s an indictment of the Bengals’ front office that this isn’t closer. Expecting a significant turnaround from Cincy’s defense without any major offseason additions is nonsensical. Burrow and the offense cannot play any better than last season. Most have penciled in a repeat performance, but if the group falls back to Earth even slightly, they’ll miss the playoffs again. OC The Ravens have a top-tier defense, the ageless Derrick Henry, a receiver group that’s better than you think, a great offensive line when healthy, and one Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr, the best player in the NFL. That will be enough to get them past the Rodgers drama in Pittsburgh, and the defense-lite Bengals, no matter how well Burrow plays. DF The Ravens rival the Eagles for most stacked roster in football, especially with the additions of Jaire Alexander and Malaki Starks to the secondary. The division will be competitive thanks to Pittsburgh’s defense and Cincinnati’s still-promising offense. MJ The Ravens and Bengals offenses are stacked with talent but defense will earn Baltimore another year on top. Addressing their pass coverage by bringing in Alexander signals the Ravens’ intent to go all the way. GS In the toughest division in the NFL, each Sunday will be a battle. The Steelers will remain competitive under Tomlin, the Bengals will score a slew of points, and the Ravens are in Super Bowl or bust mode. After the final snap, Jackson and the Ravens will be the last team standing in the division. AS AFC South champ It’s hard not to get caught up in the Jacksonville hype train. No team has a higher floor or ceiling given the weapons on offense and the new coaching staff. But the offensive line is too leaky and the staff too green to clinch a division race over the Texans. OC The Texans offense is solid enough, while their defense is among the league’s best, with the NFL’s best cornerback in Derek Stingley Jr, and a host of dominant players. DF The Titans should at least be entertaining as they start their rebuild with Ward. We can’t say the same about the Colts, who are rolling out Daniel Jones as their win-now option. Houston easily win the division with their top-five defense, and if new OC Nick Caley can turn Stroud back into a superstar, the Texans could toy with the AFC’s best. MJ Jacksonville are an exciting prospect with a rookie head coach providing an unknown quantity after Doug Pederson’s stale, shambling Jaguars. That said, an offensive line now hopefully able to protect Stroud and a brutal defense led by Anderson should be good enough to seal the Texans another divisional title. GS The Texans will take care of business and possibly surprise a few teams in the playoffs. The Jaguars won’t make the playoffs, but will be a fun team to watch as Hunter plays both sides of the ball and Trevor Lawrence aims to prove that he can live up to the $275m contract extension. AS AFC West champ This could be the year the Chiefs’ grip on the division falls. The Broncos are loaded on both sides of the ball. They have the best four-man pass-rush in the NFL and the league’s best blitz designer. Nix doesn’t need to take a major leap forward for Denver to be a force. Still, it’s hard to bet against the Mahomes-Reid axis. OC The Broncos last won the AFC West in 2015, when they also won the Super Bowl with the NFL’s best defense. The 2025 Broncos also have the NFL’s best defense, and the Nix/Payton relationship will bear unexpected dividends for the offense. DF Payton reminded everyone what a good coach he is. Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers are teeming with potential, though the Rashawn Slater season-ending injury was a massive loss. Both have playoff potential. But it’s the Chiefs until it ain’t. Kansas City’s new offensive line will need to perform but reviews for rookie tackle Josh Simmons have been mostly good. MJ The Chiefs should come out on top. But the Broncos are starving for success, have a league-leading defense and a coach who can match Reid. GS The Chiefs will win the AFC West for the 10th year in a row, but they’ll face more challenges from division foes. The Payton-led Broncos were one of only three teams to defeat the Chiefs last year. Harbaugh’s Chargers will also take aim at KC as they fight for a playoff slot. Carroll will lead the Raiders’ rebuilding efforts and guide young talent such as All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers and Jeanty. AS NFC East champ The defending Super Bowl champs steamrolled through the playoffs last season, but it’s easy to forget they were not a juggernaut for all of 2024. The Eagles’ defense dominated from the off, but the offense lacked rhythm, relying on a boom-or-bust style that hit in the postseason. If new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo can help bring some precision to Hurts’ game, Philly will be even better this year. OC The Eagles have enough to hold off the Commanders, mostly on defense (when you have Vic Fangio as your defensive coordinator, that’s an edge in and of itself). Even if Saquon Barkley regresses from one of the best running back seasons ever, there’s still enough on the ball for the defending champs. DF Is there a more foolproof roster in the NFL than the Eagles? Daniels’s presence automatically makes Washington a threat. The less said about Dallas and New York the better. MJ The Eagles will be wary as the Commanders have strengthened the offense around Daniels, but the Super Bowl champions’ stronger defense should edge the division. GS The Eagles will win back-to-back division titles as they hold off the surging Commanders. Daniels will build on his impressive rookie of the year campaign, but the Commanders’ defensive weaknesses will be the key reason they fail to take over the division. The Cowboys are coping with Jones’s decision to trade Parsons, and the Giants are no longer the most important team in New York. AS NFC North champ The Packers have everything a contender needs. They can run the ball. They can create chunk plays in the passing game. Their secondary force turnovers, even if they gag up big plays. Oh, and they have excellent coaching and a top-tier quarterback. With the addition of Parsons, they will have a potent pass-rush. OC The Lions are dealing with losing offensive coordinator Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn. The Vikings need to insert McCarthy, essentially a rookie, in as quarterback. The Bears have improved but are not quite there yet. That leaves the Packers, with a healthy Love, rookie Matthew Golden as the No 1 receiver, and Parsons to lead an underrated defense. DF This is where the Parsons trade becomes division altering. If he is the same player we saw in Dallas, and if Love can stay healthy, the Packers are in tremendous shape. Detroit are offensive powerhouse but demons from last season’s playoffs and major turnover on the coaching staff will leave them just short of the division. Minnesota are also a strong contender if McCarthy can step up. Everything else is in place. MJ The frozen north was looking open considering that Green Bay, Detroit and Minnesota all made the playoffs last season. And all three could do so again. However the Parsons trade has given the Packers a huge boost on defense while likely providing a similar bump to the team’s confidence. The Lions and Vikings will be fighting for wildcards. GS The Packers will hold off the Lions as Parsons anchors Green Bay’s top-five defense and Love leads an improved offense. The Vikings will also remain in the mix, but Darnold’s absence will be felt. AS NFC South champ The Buccaneers have the most well-rounded roster in the division, including the best offensive line in the league – when Tristan Wirfs is healthy. Tampa’s ceiling is the NFC title game, depending on how well Baker Mayfield gels with his new offensive play-caller. OC Buccaneers quarterback Mayfield is coming off his best season to date, and has great receivers. Bucky Irving may be the NFL’s most underrated running back, the offensive line is led by Wirfs, the best offensive lineman in the NFL, and Todd Bowles got enough pass-rush reinforcement in the draft and free agency to improve a unit he was unhappy with in 2024. DF Mayfield’s phenomenal 2024 may not be an outlier, given the Buccaneers’ cadre of elite receivers. Plus, this is another win-by-default situation given the rest of the division is in rebuild mode. MJ The Panthers’ last crown came 10 years ago when they monstered the league with a 15-1 record. No such dominance will be forthcoming from them or their rivals, none of whom have shown any significant signs of improvement in the offseason, so this division is there for the taking. If Young can keep his run of form going from the backend of last season then the Panthers could spring a huge surprise. GS A two-team race between the Buccaneers and Falcons. The Bucs are a more balanced team, but the Falcons boast a high-powered offense that will make them a threat in the NFC. Similar to last season, the division will be decided by one or two games. The Falcons’ offensive firepower will be the difference-maker and lead a return to the playoffs for the first time in seven years. AS NFC West champ A second bold prediction: the Seahawks will have the best defense in the NFL. But Darnold, in a new environment and behind a flaky offensive line, will keep them from winning the division. Every year the Niners have been healthy under Kyle Shanahan, they’ve made the big dance. But they’re neither healthy nor as talented as in previous years, particularly along the defensive line. Stafford’s health remains a going concern in LA. The Cardinals sneak it with a solid offense and a chaotic defense. OC We’re assuming two things here – first, that Stafford’s back issues play into the season, and that Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak can make the most of Darnold. Seattle may have a top-five defense, and that could be enough in a division where too much is uncertain elsewhere. DF With all due respect to Garoppolo, the resurgent Rams’ Super Bowl hopes lie on the back of Stafford. And that back is healthy enough … for now. The Rams are so well-coached and stacked that barring injury, they may coast to the division title. The 49ers will sneak into the postseason via wildcard thanks to the NFL’s easiest schedule and Robert Saleh back leading the defense. MJ San Francisco endured a feature length nightmare in 2024. That cursed 6-11 season puts head coach Mike Shanahan under pressure to deliver a deep playoff run or move on. And while the Rams and Cardinals are going to provide very stiff competition, the 49ers have a point to prove. GS Purdy is a sleeper MVP candidate, and the return of Saleh as defensive coordinator brings the 49ers back to Super Bowl form. The Rams stand as the biggest hurdle for San Francisco, but the health and age of Stafford could be a major concern as the season unfolds. AS AFC wildcard teams Broncos, Bengals, Jaguars. OC Chiefs, Bengals, Chargers. DF Broncos, Bengals, Chargers. MJ Chiefs, Bengals, Jaguars. GS Steelers, Chargers, Broncos. AS NFC wildcard teams Seahawks, Lions, Vikings. OC Rams, Lions, Commanders. DF Lions, Commanders, 49ers. MJ Commanders, Lions, Cardinals. GS Commanders, Lions, Buccaneers. AS AFC championship game Ravens over Bills. OC Broncos over Ravens. DF Bills over Ravens. MJ Ravens over Bills. GS Ravens over Chiefs. AS NFC championship game Packers over Eagles. OC Packers over Eagles. DF Eagles over Lions. MJ Lions over Commanders. GS Eagles over Packers. AS Super Bowl LX Ravens over Packers. It’s now or never for this version of the Ravens. The Ravens have finished fifth and seventh all-time in DVOA over the past two seasons. Jackson’s brilliance alone keeps them in contention; now, he finally has his best supporting cast. Coaching snafus hamstrung the Ravens at the start of last year, costing them home-field advantage through the playoffs. Securing the No 1 seed this year will be essential. If they can overcome worries on the interior of their offensive line, Jackson will make – and win – the first Super Bowl of his career. OC Broncos over Packers. It’s a Super Bowl XXXII rematch, with the resurgent Packers and Parsons falling just short, and the Broncos picking up their fourth Lombardi Trophy. As much as the Packers’ defense should scare Nix and company, Payton will have enough answers, and there isn’t a better defense in the NFL than Denver’s. DF Eagles over Bills. Buffalo will make it to the promised land in their seventh-straight playoff appearance. Most of the Super Bowl week hoopla will be focused on Allen and the special nature of Bills fans. All very heartwarming until the reality of the game reminds the world that the Eagles are the kings of roster-building. Simply put, the Eagles have the same roster as last year. It was the best then, and best now. This squad will also have the advantage of not being overwhelmed by the unique nature of the Super Bowl. MJ Ravens over Lions. The key for the Ravens is depth. For instance, Baltimore picked Mike Green, a pass rusher who would start for most teams, in the first round of the 2024 draft. He is conceivably their fourth-best option for getting to the QB this year. If and when the injury bug bites they can ride out the storm with depth like this across the board and lift the Lombardi. GS Eagles over Ravens. The Super Bowl has become the Kansas City Chiefs’ invitational in recent years. It’s not wise to go against the majestic Mahomes, but this time around, Jackson and the Ravens will finally get over the AFC Championship hump. In the NFC, the Eagles will take out the feisty Packers in a quest to win back-to-back titles. A showdown between Jackson and Hurts will feature theatrics as two of the league’s most exciting quarterbacks perform under the big lights. After three quarters of back-and-forth scoring, the game will be decided by which offense controls the ball in the final two minutes. Expect the more experienced Eagles to find a way to score in the waning moments to secure Super Bowl LX.

sport/blog/2025/aug/21/the-biggest-takeaway-from-izak-rankines-case-is-to-remember-why-these-rules-exist-at-all,The biggest takeaway from Izak Rankine’s case is to remember why these rules exist at all,"The flinch response to Izak Rankine’s homophobic slur was the sheer stupidity of it. Perhaps more than any other section of society, footballers are educated, counselled and warned. And it still didn’t get through. The laws of the game, particularly around ruck contests and holding the ball, are increasingly incomprehensible. But the rules in this instance couldn’t be clearer. What’s more contested is landing on an appropriate penalty. It’s easy cracking down on players who transgress in scratch matches, lower tier competitions and struggling teams. It’s more fraught when it’s a superstar. For this player, for this club, and at this stage of a long, grinding and finally fruitful rebuild, four weeks may as well be four years. Part of the problem here is that the AFL has forfeited much of the moral high ground. To be a fan, player or administer is to wrestle with a lot of paradoxes. It’s the coach bemoaning his team’s lack of effort as he stands in front of a sponsors board festooned with hamburgers and fried chicken. It’s the Swans fan sitting at the SCG – one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly venues – while signs for Qatar Airways flash in the background. It’s the league CEO who cracks down on homophobia, and then spends millions luring Snoop Dogg, hardly a model of rectitude himself. Many prominent football people seem reluctant to vocalise what they really think on this issue. An off-the-record snapshot would run roughly like this; that the AFL has overcorrected when it comes to homophobia; that they painted themselves into a corner; that the arrival of Greg Swann was an opportunity to change the paradigm; that champion players shouldn’t be missing grand finals because of name calling. Damien Hardwick skirted around it this week but pulled his punches. He has sponsors, an adjacent women’s programme and an upcoming finals campaign. But Eddie McGuire is beholden to almost no-one in football. His podcast is therefore a good insight into what many people actually think, but are loathe to say publicly. It often makes for extraordinary listening, especially for his co-host, where the emphasis is on listening. “I’d rather that he issues an apology and does community service and plays,” he said. “Because you know what, I want this [the MCG] to be filled with the best players, not being done for parking tickets. Now some people might say, a homophobic slur is far bigger than a parking ticket. No one heard it, OK? And I don’t think anyone was offended.” As someone who writes about sport, I’m often asked whether I know of any gay footballers. There are gay men commentating games, running clubs, breaking stories and winning premierships. And still, not a single footballer has come out publicly. After Saturday night, is it any wonder? Is it any wonder that a talented young male footballer grappling with his sexuality would follow this story and question whether there is a place for him in the sport? And amidst the equivocating, the negotiating and the prevailing sense that it’s always the same self-selecting people who get to determine what is and isn’t offensive, surely the likelihood of a gay footballer coming out now is even more unlikely. Something Rebecca Shaw wrote a few weeks ago got to the nub of it better than any of us in the footy bubble could ever manage – “homophobic slurs very clearly communicate your disdain for us, more effectively that your disdain for your opponent.” Rankine isn’t the first footballer to make a monumental mistake and miss an opportunity to win a premiership. The preternaturally talented and volcanic Phil Carman whacked Michael Tuck and probably cost his team a flag. Following the 2018 grand final, Andrew Gaff stood like a ghost on the margins of the celebrations. “I’ll get over it. It’ll be tough,” he told Andrew Stafford. “You feel pretty numb watching it. You don’t know what to think.” If Adelaide wins the premiership, Rankine could say something similar. He is a sublime footballer. He was born for the big stage. And he may yet pay the biggest price a footballer can pay. He knew the stakes. And he knew the rules. When the race is run and when this tinderbox of a story simmers down, hopefully the biggest takeaway is not his stupidity and not his penalty. Hopefully it’s a chance to reflect on the reason the rule was there in the first place.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/aug/21/the-biggest-takeaway-from-izak-rankines-case-is-to-remember-why-these-rules-exist-at-all,Sport,2025-08-21T07:25:42Z,2
sport/2025/aug/05/nfl-preseason-storylines-cowboys-chaos-the-browns-qb-circus-and-aaron-rodgers-last-dance,"NFL preseason storylines: Cowboys chaos, the Browns‘ QB circus and Aaron Rodgers’ last dance","Micah Parsons’ trade request Leave it to Jerry Jones to stink up the most optimistic time of year. The Cowboys owner has once again fumbled a contract negotiation with one of his stars. Despite fellow 2021 draftees Penei Sewell, Patrick Surtain II and Ja’Marr Chase signing long-term extensions, the Cowboys have allowed talks with Parsons to drag on. Last week, Parsons accused Jones of trying to circumvent his agent in negotiations and formally requested a trade. It’s fun to imagine Parsons on the trade block. What kind of haul could the Cowboys get in a trade? Three first-round picks? Two? Would the Bills make a move? The Rams? Is there a team that wouldn’t call? But let’s be clear: Parsons isn’t going anywhere. “It’s a negotiating tactic,” Jones said after Parsons’ request. For once, Jerry is right. Myles Garrett submitted a trade request to the Browns in February. A month later, he signed a $160m extension. In a league with the franchise tag, a public trade request is one of the only levers a player can pull in negotiations. Parsons is simply playing his part in the public charade. This shouldn’t be difficult. As a pass-rusher, Parsons is a one-man inferno. At times last season, he single-handedly bailed out Dallas’ defense. Oh, and he is just 26 years old, slap-bang in his prime. Negotiations should have been as simple as putting the biggest non-quarterback contract in league history on the table and popping the champagne. Yet Jones has spent the offseason taking odd shots at his best player, from questioning (incorrectly) Parsons’ injury history, to freezing his agent out of discussions, to debating why he would sign any player to a four or five-year contract. “You can get hit by a car, seriously,” Jones said at one point. Seriously. By allowing talks to drag on, the Cowboys have watched Parsons’ value creep up. The edge-rushing market has ballooned this offseason, first with Garrett and then TJ Watt signing a massive extension. Last year, the Cowboys could have locked Parsons into a deal worth $34m a year. Now, the price will be closer to $42m. The Cowboys will eventually cave – as they always do. They’ll agree on a new deal on the eve of the new season, after lighting their training camp on fire and scoring Jones some headlines. JJ McCarthy The Vikings have a championship-caliber roster. They have elite skill players. They are loaded on both sides of the line of scrimmage. They have a top-five coaching staff. The only lingering question: their quarterback. How McCarthy slots into the Vikings’ offense is perhaps the most important variable in the championship race. The No 10 pick in the 2024 draft missed his rookie season with a knee injury, while Sam Darnold caught fire in relief – until he didn’t. Minnesota could have run it back with Darnold after a 14-win season, giving them a buffer to the McCarthy era. They didn’t. They bet on their infrastructure, allowing Darnold to walk and clearing the path for McCarthy. It’s a risk. Multiple playoff wins should be the expectation this year. And if McCarthy can be a solid starter in his debut season, the Vikings will have legitimate title aspirations. If you asked the computer to simulate the perfect circumstances for a first-year starter, it would probably produce something like what the Vikings offer. Head coach Kevin O’Connell has consistently produced high-wattage passing attacks, helping to generate easy chunk plays regardless of who is at quarterback. Justin Jefferson is the game’s best receiver, Jordan Addison is a solid second option and tight end TJ Hockenson is a difference-maker when healthy. Minnesota also spent the bulk of the offseason upgrading both lines, notably adding Ryan Kelly and Will Fries from the Colts on the offensive side, one of the craftiest interior line tandems in the league. If there were deficiencies last year, it was the team’s run game and conceding pressure up the middle. The new duo, along with rookie Donovan Jackson, should help patch over those issues. There were changes on defense, too. Brian Flores’ wackadoodle scheming carried the Vikings through tough stretches last season. This year, his unit is deeper and more explosive, with veterans Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave offering extra punch up front. The Vikings can now toggle between Flores’s bizarro looks and more basic set-ups, and should challenge the Eagles and Broncos to be the top defense in the league. If McCarthy does nothing but limit turnovers, the Vikings should keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. They will hope for more than that, but hammering away with the run game, hitting play-action shots and letting the defense feast is a viable path to the postseason. McCarthy thrived in that same environment at Michigan. If he plays with accuracy and keeps the offense churning, the Vikings will be a playoff force. The Browns’ quarterback circus What can you say about the Browns? There are banana republics with more stable leadership than Cleveland. It’s early August, so it’s not a full-scale disaster … yet. But the training camp reports make for grim reading. For a team in desperate need of a viable long-term starter, double-dipping on quarterbacks in the draft made sense. But the Browns now have a bloated quarterback competition, featuring 40-year-old Joe Flacco, a limping Kenny Pickett, and two underbaked rookies, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. No pressure, Kevin Stefanski (on Monday night, reports emerged they are signing another quarterback, Tyler Huntley, because all of the unit bar Flacco are carrying injuries). Flacco is the nominal starter, despite team owner Jimmy Haslam saying he expects to see both rookies play at some point this season. Gabriel has received a ton of practice reps with the first team, but the early returns have been scattershot at best. Cleveland may hold on to all four quarterbacks into the regular season, unless one of the rookies grabs the starting gig in preseason, freeing up the team to move on from Pickett or Flacco. Chucking rookie quarterbacks into the mayhem to figure out what you have sounds like a fine idea until they line up behind a depleted group. Whoever winds up as the starter will be playing with an ad hoc roster: the offensive line is a mixture of fossilized former Pro Bowlers and projects; there is a lack of reliable pass-catchers outside of Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku. If you’re looking for positives, watch the defense. The Browns have plenty of talent on that side of the ball, but even some of that has already been stripped away by injuries and a late retirement. It’s shaping up to be a messy year. Once, the Browns were fun upstarts. Now, they’re a depressing mystery again. If the team stumbles early, Stefanski could be out of a job by Thanksgiving. Miami temperature check Speaking of hot seats. Mike McDaniel’s seat in Miami is pretty toasty. After reaching the playoffs twice in McDaniel’s first two seasons, the Dolphins fell apart last season. They were undone by injuries again, only this time it was the defense that disintegrated. They did little in the offseason to fill you with confidence. Terron Armstead, the team’s franchise left tackle, retired. The offensive line still looks rickety. Jalen Ramsey was traded. Tyreek Hill kept up his on-again, off-again relationship with a trade request, although now he’s committed to studying. Miami’s offense will continue to produce fireworks, thanks largely to McDaniel, Hill, Tua Tagovailoa, Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane. And on paper, at least, the Dolphins have one of the most talented defensive front-sevens in the sport. Jaelen Phillips, Bradley Chubb, Zach Sieler, Chop Robinson and Kenneth Grant could form one of the nastiest pass-rushes in the league. Still, the balance of the remaining roster is dicey. Heading into the season, Miami’s secondary is the flakiest position group in the league. Acquiring Minkah Fitzpatrick in the Ramsey trade will help, but he is the group’s only proven starter. They already lost their top cornerback, Kader Kohou, for the season with a knee injury. Miami brought in Mike Hilton from the scrapheap to replace Kohou and will rely on Ifeatu Melifonwu and Ashtyn Davis, two safeties with shaky injury records, to play alongside Fitzpatrick. Storm Duck, currently slated to start, was a fun story a year ago as an undrafted free agent, but he was torched in meaningful snaps as a rookie. You know you’re in trouble when Jack Jones, a fringe starter, goes from unemployed to a team’s premier corner in 10 days. The hope is that the team’s pass-rush will be so overwhelming that it can mitigate the impact of the secondary. But, at some point, it will be third-and-medium and someone in the secondary will need to make a play. Only Fitzpatrick is a dynamic playmaker, and he is on the downside of his career. The Dolphins haven’t won a playoff game since 2000. If they miss the postseason again, McDaniel will probably be out. And the current roster has too many holes to be a serious threat to the Bills in the East. The NFC West’s logjam Take a look at the NFC West. It’s stacked, comfortably the most competitive division in the league. The Rams came close to bouncing the Eagles in the playoffs last season with a young roster and have reloaded this year. The Niners remade their defense after last season’s injury apocalypse. The Cardinals are no longer just an interesting side show; they have a bruising offense and a spicy defense. The Seahawks closed last season strong, putting together a top-five defense from Week 10 onwards, and could have one of the best units in the league this season. There are no slouches. The weakest single unit in the division may be the Seahawks’ offense, and that could still crack the top half of the league. How the division shakes out will probably come down to how quickly Darnold can assimilate in Seattle. Was his career-best year in Minnesota a mirage? Will his talented but unproven offensive line hold up? Can a receiver room of Cooper Kupp, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Jaxon Smith-Njigba offset the losses of DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett? As ever, there are also the annual concerns about Matthew Stafford’s injury status to throw into the NFC mix. But if Darnold’s resurgence carries over and Stafford is healthy, then all four teams will have quality starting quarterbacks and spiky defenses. It’s going to be a bloodbath. Aaron Rodgers’ last dance Buckle up, folks. You have one more season of Rodgers to deal with. Yes, Rodgers in Pittsburgh could be a farce. It probably will be a farce. The Steelers’ decision to sign a 41-year-old Rodgers, who is two years removed from an achilles injury, after Pittsburgh *deep breath* traded for DK Metcalf, signed the receiver to a bumper extension, traded away George Pickens, benched Justin Fields for Russell Wilson, then told Fields that he was Their Guy, then told Wilson to take the first plane out of town, then lost Fields in free agency, then traded for Jalen Ramsey, then signed TJ Watt to a market-resetting extension is the kind of teenager-on-Madden approach to team-building usually reserved for the Jaguars, Panthers or the son of a Jets owner. It is weird to reach this point: somehow, the vaunted Steelers have become the league’s most directionless franchise. But the Steelers are convinced they have the backbone of a championship contender. “We’re building this team to win a Super Bowl this year,” GM Omar Khan said recently. It’s easy to chuckle at the Steelers assembling a 2022 All-Pro squad (hand up). But there’s a path to at least division contention here. If Ramsey is even 70% of the player he was in his prime, he will be a linchpin on an already outstanding defense. Whether the offense can match the defense will come down to Rodgers’ connection with offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, two stubborn offensive designers with divergent styles. Rodgers probably won’t guide the Steelers to a Super Bowl. He looked a shadow of himself last season: hesitant to stand in the pocket, worried about getting hit, unable to avoid the rush as his accuracy dwindled to key parts of the field. But if Rodgers can stay healthy, he could perhaps Peyton Manning his way through a final season, keeping the Steelers competitive as they try to bridge one team to the next. If the on-field stuff turns out to be a disaster, his lasting legacy in Pittsburgh may be convincing Mike Tomlin that more substantive changes are needed.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/05/nfl-preseason-storylines-cowboys-chaos-the-browns-qb-circus-and-aaron-rodgers-last-dance,Sport,2025-08-05T09:00:55Z,2
sport/2025/oct/28/brian-kelly-payout-lsu-college-football-coaches,$54m to walk: getting fired as a college football coach is a booming industry,"At a time when millions are at risk of going hungry and losing their medical insurance benefits, struggling Americans can at least take solace in knowing that the nation’s college football coaches are doing just fine – especially Brian Kelly. On Sunday LSU relieved Kelly of his coaching duties after his Tigers suffered a resounding home loss to Texas A&amp;M that dropped them out of the AP’s ranking of college football’s top 25 teams. (This is after LSU was ranked as high as third in September and firmly in the top 10 for most of the season.) Kelly, who was in the fourth year of a decade-long contract worth about $100m, will be going home with more than just a box full of purple and gold office trinkets. While the terms of Kelly’s departure have yet to be resolved, his contract puts the school on the hook for 90% of his deal balance if he’s fired for cause – a final tab that comes to around $54m. The contract does include a “duty to mitigate clause” that asks him to pursue another job so that LSU won’t owe him quite so much money. But another program would have to be fairly desperate to hire him, considering he went 31-14 with one college football playoff appearance at LSU, a school less than six years removed from winning a national title. The more likely scenario is that LSU will continue making $800,000 monthly payments to Kelly through 2031 while the coach, who turned 64 on Saturday, rides comfortably into retirement. It’s nice work if you can get it, especially in this economy. In the upside-down world of college athletics, the fired football coach is king. Two weeks before Kelly was terminated, Penn State fired James Franklin – a coach who is not only a year removed from leading the Nittany Lions to the College Football Playoff semi-finals, but was also instrumental in leading the program out from the aftermath of a monumental child sex abuse scandal; Penn State is paying Franklin $49m to be gone. The very next week Florida severed ties with Billy Napier, the first full-time Gators coach in 76 years to finish his tenure with a losing record (22-23); Florida is paying him $21m after his departure, and half that amount is due on 19 November. When the Gators hire Napier’s permanent replacement, it will mark their second time in seven years paying three head coaches concurrently. In fact LSU finds itself in that very spot as it begins paying out Kelly severance while winding down the school’s $17m buyout obligation to Kelly’s predecessor, Ed Orgeron. The college football season is barely past midpoint, and already 10 coaches have been fired with schools owing $169m in buyouts, including six in the elite Power 4 conferences. Those numbers don’t include Stanford’s Troy Taylor (who was fired without cause and was able to keep his buyout terms confidential thanks to the university being a private institution) or dead men walking like Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell or Florida State’s Mike Norvell – who could well find themselves out of work by Thanksgiving. Back in the day, there was no worse scenario than having to fire a college coach. It was the hard decision that had to be made to turn around losing cultures or reset from scandal. Coaches packed up their families and left town, and administrators risked losing their jobs over one bad hire, too. The humiliation ritual was all-encompassing, and the stench lingered. However in the last few years, as college athletics has evolved from a bastion of amateurism run by a cartel into a freer marketplace that favors star players, a private equity mindset has taken hold among sports benefactors who fuel blockbuster programs. There is a greater openness to treating coaches like the rainmaking execs they are to their hundred-million dollar athletic departments. Two years ago it seemed outrageous that Texas A&amp;M would pay Jimbo Fisher a record $77m after firing him. But Georgia would owe Kirby Smart $105m if they fired him right now, not that it would after making him college football’s highest-paid coach last spring. Well, not that it would theoretically. And even though the money used to pay these buyouts mostly comes out of TV deals and sponsorships that athletic departments rake in, it’s not hard to imagine the scholarships that could be awarded or the women’s and Olympic sports programs that could be reinstated with all that cash. These very same institutions claim financial hardship when athletes demand an equitable share of the revenues they help produce – and blame the buyout spending spree on the donors paying that freight. “[Donors] think they have a voice, and they’re just like a bunch of fans,” the respected former coach Nick Saban said last week. “When they get frustrated and disappointed, they put pressure on the [athletic directors] to take action, and it’s the way of the world.” But ultimately it’s Kelly who makes the more convenient villain among media and fans for a college coaching buyout craze run amok. Although respected for his strategic mind and knack for turning around wayward programs, Kelly breaks from the avuncular college coach stereotype. He doesn’t simply lack Orgeron’s rascal energy or the folksy charm of Les Miles, to name another LSU predecessor; he appears to be a repellant personality. San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh remembers starting out on Kelly’s Central Michigan coaching staff alongside Matt LaFleur, now the Green Bay Packers head coach, in the early-2000s. Kelly invited them to a social event at his house –but only so they could park cars and shovel snow, in a scene ripped from Coming to America. “We decided that when we’re in that position, we’re never going to treat people the way we got treated,” Saleh told ESPN. After LSU hired him in December 2021, Kelly, a proper Irish-Catholic Bay Stater, introduced himself to a stunned Tigers basketball crowd in a horrific southern accent that was widely mocked online. At Notre Dame, which was rehabilitated under Kelly in the 2010s, he complained about the school’s lofty academic standards undercutting his ability to build rosters. At LSU, he moaned about having to pay players under the current NIL system while committing more than $10m a year to assistant coaches he also couldn’t gel with – contracts that the school will also have to buy out. One of Kelly’s more egregious errors was firing Tommy Moffitt, the beloved strength coach behind LSU’s last three national titles, and setting him up for sweet revenge at Texas A&amp;M – who Moffitt has helped mold into the country’s third-best team, as Kelly saw for himself last Saturday. In the end it was Louisiana governor Jeff Landry – who makes around one-10th of Kelly’s state salary – calling for the coach’s job that forced the LSU board’s hand. Not long after getting pink-slipped, Kelly was spotted dining alone at a Mexican chain restaurant – as if finally getting around to celebrating that birthday of his, but with no actual friends to show up for him. On Monday, Washington state congressman Michael Baumgartner, a Republican, introduced a bill titled Correcting Opportunity and Accountability in Collegiate Hiring (or COACH) that would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to cap the total annual compensation of any athletics department employee at no more than 10 times the institution’s annual in-state costs for a full-time undergraduate student – about $280,000 in LSU’s case. “There is no greater societal benefit to have a coach make $10m versus $200,000,” Baumgartner told Sportico. But the odds of his proposal making it out of committee, as Sportico’s Daniel Libit rightly observed, “is slimmer than the chance of every FBS coach keeping their job for the rest of the season”. College football teams like to think of themselves as the “front porch” to their academic institutions. But lately it’s looking more like the White House’s proposed East Wing ballroom: a monstrous addition that threatens to overshadow everything else. With the average American already struggling to make ends meet, much less stump up for college football tickets, the idea of paying a coach millions of dollars to sit at home is as jarring as expecting LSU to run the table with interim coach Frank Wilson. The colleges and power conferences could curb some of the post-employment spending themselves by setting buyout cap conditions and making coaching contracts shorter with more performance-based terms. But it’s unlikely that much will change, especially in the current political climate, until the money dries up. At this rate the day may not be too far off.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/28/brian-kelly-payout-lsu-college-football-coaches,Sport,2025-10-28T13:46:22Z,1
sport/2025/oct/26/lando-norris-f1-mexico-city-gp-max-verstappen-oscar-piastri-title-race,Lando Norris hits the front in title race with emphatic F1 Mexico City GP win,"If timing is key in any race, Lando Norris might just have taken the bell with absolutely impeccable judgment. His victory at the Mexico City Grand Prix with a consummate drive from pole to flag has catapulted him into the lead of an intense title fight at exactly the right moment. Norris has momentum at the very point the championship enters its decisive phase. With his title rivals Oscar Piastri – Norris’s McLaren teammate – managing only fifth and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen third at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Norris has the edge at a crucial juncture with four meetings remaining. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finished in second, while Britain’s Oliver Bearman took a career-best fourth place with a superb drive for Haas. For Norris, dominant and unchallenged from the moment he held the lead through turn one, this was a huge result – the first time he has held the lead of the championship since before the Saudi Arabian GP in April. After Piastri moved ahead in Jeddah, the Australian has maintained a grip on the front but Norris has made his comeback at an enormously significant moment. Norris now leads Piastri by one point with Verstappen in third, 36 behind. The two McLaren teammates lead the charge then but the defending champion is still very much in the game and all three are likely to take the title to the wire in the season finale at Abu Dhabi. It represents a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for Norris, who had been left disconsolate after he endured a mechanical failure at the Dutch GP in August. The DNF dropped the 25-year-old driver to 34 points behind Piastri, at which stage Verstappen was 104 points in arrears and the Australian appeared to hold all the cards. Norris said after the race at Zandvoort that he would likely have to throw caution to the wind in order to catch his teammate and it appeared a reasonable stance. However, what followed was a controlled and measured response that has proved hugely effective. “Zandvoort is still very clear in my head,” he said. “You forget about that as much as you can and you just focus on every race coming up. This has easily been my best performance but there’s still a long way to go. I just have to keep doing what I’m doing, keep trying to be consistent against some very quick guys around me and I think that’ll be good.” As Verstappen and Red Bull found their form with a series of upgrades, Norris kept his head down and returned a string of solid podium finishes, marred only by a costly poor qualifying in Baku. He was assisted in no little part by Piastri experiencing his worst form of the year after having been on the podium for every race bar one between the second meeting of the season and Monza. Piastri made a false start in Baku and then crashed out with an unforced error, could manage only fourth in Singapore and fifth in Austin. A similarly lacklustre weekend in Mexico has led to his lead being erased. Poor qualifying was costly and starting in seventh he found himself mired in a midfield struggle from which he could make little impact. With 116 points still on the table, where the two McLaren drivers stand in relation to each other could yet become a decisive differentiator. The team principal, Andrea Stella, has said they would prioritise one driver should it be required to ensure they seal their first drivers’ championship since 2008. If Verstappen makes further inroads in the forthcoming rounds and the team choose to head off the threat, they will favour the pedaller in front. Having the lead in these late stages then is, potentially, more important than ever. Norris has that edge, having delivered with cool assurance in Mexico City. He held his lead in a breathtaking run on the drag to turn one as the leaders went three abreast, and within several laps he had opened a seven-second gap from which, in clean air, he was relentless to the flag. Piastri had a shocking start, however, dropping amid the jostling down the straight from seventh to 10th. He had to fight back across the remaining 70 laps and did well to make it to fifth, including a decisive move on George Russell on lap 61. But it was at best damage limitation of the form he can no longer afford. Verstappen, too, eked out the maximum from fifth on the grid, on a counter strategy. Indeed he might have taken second at the death but for a virtual safety car being called on the penultimate lap. Nonetheless with the Red Bull not at its best in Mexico he considered he had extracted all he could. For McLaren, to defeat Verstappen so comprehensively will give them encouragement that their car still has an advantage in certain conditions. On a surface which punished the rubber the ease with which their car handles its tyres, an area where they have excelled this season, once more proved to be vital. Norris was able to push the car harder and faster and will feel his tilt at the title is now well and truly on, while his teammate is left wondering how the lead he held for 15 rounds has slipped from his grasp within sight of the finishing line. Lewis Hamilton might have been fighting for his first podium with Ferrari but for a 10sec penalty for gaining an advantage by leaving the track when competing with Verstappen and he finished in eighth.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/26/lando-norris-f1-mexico-city-gp-max-verstappen-oscar-piastri-title-race,Sport,2025-10-26T22:02:39Z,1
sport/2025/oct/25/lando-norris-claims-f1-mexico-city-gp-pole-as-oscar-piastri-flounders,Lando Norris claims F1 Mexico City GP pole as teammate Oscar Piastri falters,"Lando Norris claimed pole position for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with a superb lap for McLaren at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. The Briton left his title rivals in his wake and in so doing earned a chance to make a major impact on the championship standings and potentially retake the lead. Enjoying a huge boost to his world championship ambitions, Norris delivered perhaps his best lap of the season in qualifying, to beat the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton into second and third. Of greater import was that his fellow title protagonists Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri, Norris’s McLaren teammate, could manage only fifth and eighth fastest respectively. The pole was a real statement of intent from Norris and McLaren and exactly the riposte they required after the recent momentum Verstappen has gathered as he closed the gap to the leaders. Having been 104 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August, the defending champion has won three of the last four meetings and is now just 40 points off the Australian and 14 points behind Norris. It has been an extraordinary turnaround for Red Bull and their driver, and after which Norris badly needed to reassert some authority, having not taken pole since the Belgian GP. To finally do so and start the race from the front foot was a major step in steadying the ship. If he wins and Piastri finishes below fourth, the British driver will hold the lead of the championship for the first time since the fifth round of the season in Saudi Arabia. Norris acknowledged that it had been a significant moment he hoped to exploit. “I’m happy to be back on pole, it’s been a long time,” he said. “It’s one of those laps where you don’t know what happened, it felt decent but when I saw it was a [one minute] 15.5, I was surprised. “I’m here to win. I’ll be looking forward, I have some quick guys behind me. I’m not expecting it to be easy.” He exhibited a cool command in qualifying that was indicative of how the McLaren remains an enormously strong car and indeed how comfortable and confident Norris can be when he has it hooked up. This stood in stark contrast to his teammate, however. Piastri struggled, off the pace of the frontrunners and unable to challenge for the top spot. It was a similar lack of competitiveness to that he experienced at the last round in Austin as the Australian’s pace over the single lap he demonstrated earlier in the season appears to be sorely lacking. He has not qualified better than third since the Dutch GP, which has been crucial in the way his title lead has been whittled away. He will start from seventh owing to a grid penalty for Williams’s Carlos Sainz. Third place was also a significant moment for Hamilton, his first top three qualifying place of the season and he enjoyed the moment after a difficult start to his new career with Ferrari. “I’m really happy, I’m honoured to be up here with Charles and Lando, these guys have been so quick all year,” Hamilton said. “It’s obviously hard to beat these guys but P3 is the perfect spot at this track, so I’m hoping to make the most of that.” McLaren, who have not been on pole here since Gerhard Berger took the top spot in 1990, will also be confident there is more to come, for Norris at least. Their car has looked very strong in race-pace simulations in Mexico, with Norris putting in some very strong runs. The long drag to turn one of 830m may prove crucial as the leaders jockey for a slipstream, and emerging in clean air in front from the first corner could be key, but on this form keeping the leading McLaren behind in any circumstances is likely to be a mighty task. Norris had been comfortably on top heading into the first runs in Q3 when Verstappen opened with a strong first lap with a time of 1min 16.455sec. Norris followed and with an immense second and third sectors went quicker by almost three tenths. Leclerc had more to come and managed to take the top spot from Norris, with Hamilton moving up to third in front of Verstappen, as Ferrari showed real pace. On the final runs Piastri was the first of the McLarens out, with Verstappen in his wake. The Australian could not match Leclerc and Verstappen also missed out, but Norris was flying behind them. Fastest in both the first two sectors, he threw the car into the corners to claim pole with an aggressive precision that Leclerc could not match, ultimately achieving an exceptional lap with a time of 1:15.586, more than two tenths up on the Ferrari.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/25/lando-norris-claims-f1-mexico-city-gp-pole-as-oscar-piastri-flounders,Sport,2025-10-25T22:34:56Z,1

Across the manicured green turf at Lord’s, inside cricket’s most celebrated media centre, the main commentary box is named after this generational tormentor. About 84 miles away, at the Rose Bowl near Southampton, an entire stand bears his name. English cricket has every reason to hate Shane Warne. In 36 Ashes Tests, he bagged 195 wickets at an average of 23.25. From his opening ball of the century at Old Trafford in 1993 to his final bow in Sydney in 2007, he seemed to operate on a different plane. This peroxided devil ruined summers and deepened cold, bitter winters, yet he became an English national treasure, the perfect reminder that cricket, above all else, is something that should be enjoyed. Warne was everything the English stereotype wasn’t: a technicoloured rogue in a land of beige, a beer-chugging, chain-smoking larrikin plucked straight out of central casting. As Nietzsche once wrote: “To love is to be in a state of perpetual want.” Perhaps that’s the secret to England’s endearment, the joy of yearning for what could never be theirs. In other cases, affection comes from recognition, when a rival seems to share a nation’s sporting DNA. Nowhere is that clearer than with Virat Kohli in Australia. Few visiting players have been booed so loudly or applauded so enthusiastically. At first, his snarls and send-offs grated, as if he was trying to cosplay as something that he wasn’t, as if he had forgotten that Test captains should stick to the archetypes they have been assigned. By the end Australians realised they were looking at something uncomfortably familiar. He became, in their eyes, the worthy antagonist. “Kohli redefined expectations, challenged conventions and symbolised the self-assured, unapologetic India of the 21st century,” the former Australia captain Greg Chappell wrote last year. He was not copying the Australians; he was mirroring them, feeding their energy back at them with the volume turned up. They came to admire him not because he tried to be different, but because he played as they believed cricket should be played. Kohli’s numbers in Australia speak for themselves. In one-day internationals he has piled up 2,451 runs in 51 matches at an average north of 53. In Tests, he has tallied 2,232 runs at 43.76 in 30 outings. His nine hundreds are the most he registered against any opposition and his twin-ton display in Adelaide in 2014 stands as one of the greatest individual performances in the country. Like a true blue Aussie he leaned into the fight and gave as good as he got. Having bowed out of Tests and Twenty20 internationals, his curtain call in the ODI series has carried a sombre tone. His duck in the first of three matches drew muted celebrations, the Perth crowd knowing this would be the last time they’d see him in the flesh. Then there are players who are loved simply for their style and grace, the ones who melt borders altogether. AB de Villiers never played for India, but you wouldn’t know it. In Bengaluru, where he spent a decade with the Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League, crowds treated him less as an overseas professional than as a favourite son. The South African stroke-maker, nicknamed “Mr 360” for the way he reimagined the geometry of batting, became a symbol of how invention and humility can coexist. Where Warne thrilled with his unconquerable wizardry and Kohli compelled respect through combat, De Villiers connected through joy. “India is my second home, I’m half-Indian now and proud of that,” he said. “I fell in love with the culture, the country, the people and their absolute love for cricket. I’ll always be grateful for all the love this beautiful country so unconditionally gives me.” All of this still feels rare in cricket. Even with the rise of franchise leagues and the blurring of borders, the game remains stubbornly tribal. International cricket endures as the sport’s pinnacle while carrying echoes of a previous age when distinctions between “us” and “them” were more stark. Despite cricket’s devotion to an idealised code of conduct its rivalries seem to be built from harder, more ancient stones. However, they are prone to leaks. This is part of cricket’s charm. The long hours, the undulations across a day’s play, the tours that stretch into months; perhaps this is what allows villains to turn into folkloric figures with Shakespearean arcs. The longer you let the narrative breathe, the harder it is to hold on to hate for some players who, whether we like it or not, have earned our respect. In the end, all the noise settles into admiration for their skill and their spirit, for the audacity to play this strange, beautiful game in a way no one else quite can. It is why De Villiers has a home away from home. It is why fans in Sydney will rise to their feet when Kohli leaves the scene one last time at the SCG on Saturday. It is why Warne’s portrait hangs at Lord’s and why the pain he inflicted on English cricket is celebrated in both hemispheres. That is the paradox at the heart of cricket. You spend a lifetime picking sides only to realise it is the game itself you ever loved. This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

sport/2025/oct/21/my-netflix-show-would-be-white-collar-to-world-champion-fabio-wardley-on-his-boxing-journey,‘My Netflix show would be White Collar to World Champion’: Fabio Wardley on his boxing journey,"“Joseph Parker was a world heavyweight champion in 2016 when I was still having white‑collar fights,” Fabio Wardley says of the contrasting career paths he and his opponent have taken before their crucial bout at the O2 in London on Saturday. “So it’s been a wild, wild journey for us to reach this point. And if I get through this fight I’ll get a chance to meet Oleksandr Usyk. Fighting Usyk for the world title would be a funny story, remembering how I went to Ukraine to spar him seven years ago. It would feel like I’ve come full circle.” We’re sitting in the back room of a gym in Wardley’s home town of Ipswich and the amiable and intelligent 30‑year‑old, who is unbeaten after 20 professional contests, allows himself to get a little excited before confronting the serious threat of Parker. He nods when I suggest that it sounds like an outlandish boxing movie or overheated drama series. Wardley smiles, and says: “I’ve got a title for Netflix already. It’s going to be called White Collar to World Champion. I think it rolls pretty well.” Nine years ago, when Parker beat Andy Ruiz Jr to win the WBO world heavyweight title, Wardley was commuting from Ipswich to London where he worked for a recruitment agency. His task then, apart from the occasional scrap on the white‑collar circuit, was to find jobs for health and social workers. Years later, he risks his health every time he climbs into the ring. Wardley’s British and Commonwealth title fight with Frazer Clarke in March 2024 was the most savage example. The canvas resembled a Jackson Pollock painting, with most of the blood shed by Wardley, and both fighters went to dark places during a battle that ended in a draw. Clarke told me he was afraid he might die while he lay on his hotel bed after the fight. Wardley grimaces: “I was also badly beat up. I had a cut on my nose, my face was bleeding. My shorts, my outfit, everything was covered in blood. That was my first real touch of how serious and dangerous boxing can be. “My head was rocking for days. I was eating only ice-cream and noodles for four days because I couldn’t chew. I had that puffy eye I couldn’t see out of, a split nose, cuts all inside my mouth. In a weird, twisted way, once I’d come back to some normality, it felt good having gone through that. You can be the biggest bluffer to yourself but until you actually do it, and come through the other side, you can’t really say: ‘OK, that [courage] is in me. That’s there.’” What was he thinking amid the fury of the fight? “I distinctly remember sitting on my stool at the end of round six. I was like: ‘So everything I’ve just done, I’ve got to do all over again?’ But I only allow myself five seconds before it’s like: ‘Right, let’s get back to it.’ You’ve got no time to think: ‘Oh, I hurt and this is not going well.’ Those thoughts evaporate. It’s funny how having someone on the other side of the ring trying to take your head off narrows your focus. The O2 Arena will always have a piece of my soul. I left a little bit of me in that ring.” Wardley insists he does not think in detail about the long-term consequences of boxing. “I made peace with it when I decided to take the sport seriously. I’ve accepted that there is a worst-case scenario and that’s how it could go. As long as you’re OK with that, crack on.” But he offers a layered answer when I ask him to describe his emotions after he knocked out Clarke chillingly in the first round of the rematch last October. “Conflicting. As fantastic as it is to get a knockout like that, it’s a stark reminder of how very easily that could happen to me. I was obviously full of joy but I was within touching distance of that devastation. I was the one that did it to Frazer. I was closer than anyone to seeing again that brutal side of boxing.” On Saturday he returns to the same venue where he lost something of his soul. “I might need to find it, and use it, against Parker,” he quips. Wardley was initially a footballer, who played for the academy at his cherished Ipswich Town, and he only discovered boxing years after he met Robert Hodgins. “I’ve known Rob since I was 12,” Wardley recalls. “He was my mentor in a programme called Positive Futures for unruly children who seemed to continually find themselves in trouble. Rob was always trying to get me into boxing but I was only interested in football. “Years later, when I was 20, after injuries took me away from football, I gave Rob a call and said: ‘You’ve been trying to get me in boxing for years. Where’s the gym? I’ll give it a go.’” If he had not met Hodgins, Wardley could have ended up living a life littered with trouble and even criminality. “Not because it’s seductive,” he suggests, “but more out of necessity. Circumstances mean you look to your left and right and [crime] is all you see. It feels normal. It took me a few years to work my way out of that and it was then I walked into the gym and I never left. I did a boxing session and it wiped me out – but I was buzzing. “I wanted to do more. Some of the more experienced lads were hanging for sparring and I asked Rob if I could jump in and he was like: ‘Are you sure?’ I was really overeager and he allowed me in with one of the older lads, an ex‑ABA champion who beat me up for three rounds and dropped me a couple of times.” Wardley laughs. “Maybe I’m missing a screw because it made me more excited. I was like: ‘I want to be as good as you, if not better than you.’ That’s what the next few years were all about catching the next guy in front of me. It was that constant incremental progression.” He had only four white-collar fights before turning pro and so, when considering the vast amateur experience of many of his opponents, Wardley has sometimes suffered from impostor syndrome. But he has also proved adept at quelling the internal doubts. “I’ve become better at doing that. Every new opponent’s better, the occasion is bigger, so with each different level there is a new enemy to conquer within your own brain. But you build evidence over time. ‘I did XYZ to get me through that situation.’ I can carry that over and that will drag me through.” In his most recent bout, in June, Wardley faced the unbeaten Australian Justis Huni, who had been an excellent amateur at international level. Huni is also a more skilled boxer and Wardley came close to his first defeat. Trailing badly on all three scorecards after nine rounds, he knocked out Huni with electrifying power in the 10th. “I was losing that fight but it was never overbearing,” he says. “I always felt I was making small strides. Maybe they went unnoticed but, even when the round as a whole didn’t go my way, I took a little bit from it and thought that worked. Take that, bank that. I was figuring it out because he was very tricky, very good with his feet and hands. So there was a lot of trial and error before we adjusted the gameplan and I got the knockout.” Wardley is realistic when acknowledging the vast gulf that separates even an accomplished amateur and adroit pro such as Huni from Usyk – an Olympic and two-time undisputed world heavyweight champion. His recognition of Usyk’s superior skill is rooted in first-hand experience of sparring with the Ukrainian in Kyiv in 2018. “It was very random,” Wardley recalls. “I got a Facebook message in broken English from a member of Usyk’s team. I didn’t believe it because it was quite abrupt: ‘Hi Fabio, do you want to come Ukraine spar Usyk?’ It didn’t seem authentic so I asked my manager to look into it. After a day or two we realised it was genuine. “Two weeks later I arrived at the airport and they had a guy with my name on a bit of paper. He didn’t say a word, just nodded and actioned me to follow him to his white van which had no windows. We drove for 45 minutes and the guy never spoke. I was like: ‘This is it. I’m done for. I’m lost in the depths of Ukraine and no one’s ever going to find me again.’ But he drove me to my hotel, gave me some money for food and he pointed me to be waiting tomorrow at 3pm. “I got to meet Usyk the next day. I’d built this picture in my head of how it was going to be really strict and regimented but he was dancing and laughing and messing around. He came over and he said: ‘Hi, hello, welcome,’ shook my hand and I immediately settled and I was like: ‘OK, this is great. He’s a great guy.’” Wardley had been professional for only a year then and so he was staggered by Usyk’s brilliance. But he was not cowed. “I don’t know if I caught him that well but, a couple of times, I landed. He definitely made me pay but it was an incredible experience for three weeks. We all went for dinner every night and he was really nice and inclusive.” His eyes widen at the giddy prospect that a surprise victory against Parker would probably lead to a world title fight against Usyk. “Fingers crossed,” Wardley says with a grin. He becomes more serious as he concentrates on the mighty challenge awaiting him against Parker – who has been in brilliant form the last two years while dispatching Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole. “We have followed different paths to reach this stage,” Wardley says, “but we both know that if we win this fight there’s a huge chance against Usyk. Parker’s already been to the top of the mountain, a world champion, so he knows what that feels like. He wants it again and he’s within touching distance. So the ambition will put a fire in him that can’t be understated.” Wardley has the same fire but this is a huge step up for him. He remains confident and, asked if he sees any weaknesses in the vastly experienced New Zealander, says: “Yes, there are a number of what I prefer to call gaps, flaws, in the way he fights. There are certain habits that we have identified and are going to pick out on the night. But he’s also proved time and again that, when he is caught and knocked down, he always gets back up.” The former white-collar slugger pauses and then, with quiet intent, he says: “I know it’s going to be very hard. But that’s only to be expected. This is a very long way from where I started.”",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/21/my-netflix-show-would-be-white-collar-to-world-champion-fabio-wardley-on-his-boxing-journey,Sport,2025-10-21T07:00:35Z,1
sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics,NFL bets big on Saudi Arabia with Tom Brady-led flag football showcase,"The National Football League is making a significant move to raise its global profile after years of struggling to expand beyond its domestic roots. The league announced last week that the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, headlined by seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, will take place on 21 March 2026, at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The showcase event is expected to serve as a major lead-in to flag football’s debut at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, where the NFL hopes the sport’s inclusion will accelerate its growth worldwide. Produced by OBB Media and Fanatics, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic will feature a round-robin tournament with three teams composed of former NFL greats and current stars, including Saquon Barkley (Philadelphia Eagles), CeeDee Lamb (Dallas Cowboys), Christian McCaffrey (San Francisco 49ers), Sauce Gardner (New York Jets), Brock Bowers (Las Vegas Raiders), Maxx Crosby (Las Vegas Raiders), Tyreek Hill (Miami Dolphins) and Myles Garrett (Cleveland Browns). “I have always admired the power of flag football and how it connects fans of all ages, and it’s awesome to be able to showcase the sport on such a global stage while joining together so many incredibly skilled athletes,” Brady said in a press release. Organizers said additional participants from other sports and the entertainment industry will be announced later. The event will feature three teams of eight players facing off in a round-robin tournament, with the top two advancing to a championship game. It will air live on FOX Sports and Tubi, with actor and comedian Kevin Hart serving as host. Garrett, one of the NFL’s premier defensive players, said his decision to participate stems from a desire to help expand the game’s reach. “Just like every other sport has grown worldwide, we want to make [American football] the world’s game,” Garrett told the Guardian. “We’re proud to be ambassadors for this beautiful game that we love.” The NFL’s move comes as Saudi Arabia continues to expand its influence in global sports, investing billions of dollars to bring major events and athletes to the kingdom. Its push has included the launch of LIV Golf in 2022, lucrative deals to attract some of the world’s top soccer players, and high-profile boxing matches – all part of a broader effort to reshape its global image through sports. There was hesitation by many athletes then to participate, and Saudi Arabia faced intense criticism in 2022 when it launched LIV Golf, a rival league to the PGA Tour backed by its sovereign wealth fund. Now the PGA and LIV have a working agreement. Garrett said there are always challenges when starting something new. “That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it,” he said. “You should take that into account and find a way to make yourself different and still appealing. We’re trying to do that. We still love the game here, but we want to see it grow and find new areas of talent.” For Garrett, it’s another chance to showcase his sport on a global stage. But for critics, it’s part of a much bigger debate about what role Saudi Arabia – and its billions – should play in the world of sports. Critics accuse Saudi Arabia of “sportswashing” – using high-profile sports investments to improve its global image and divert attention from a record of human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the suppression of dissent, and ongoing restrictions on women’s rights and LGBTQ+ individuals. “When high-profile athletes or celebrities participate, it sends signals to global audiences that Saudi Arabia is a ‘regular’ host of major sporting events,” said Nadyeen Abdulaziz, monitoring and advocacy officer for ALQST for Human Rights. “This can dilute critical attention to the kingdom’s human rights record and shift the narrative toward economic opportunity, tourism, or entertainment, effectively softening the impact of prior critiques.” Ali Alyami, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Saudi Arabia, said the Saudi ruling family’s extravagant investment in sports is designed to divert global attention from its religious extremism and gross violations of basic human rights. Yet even amid those concerns, the NFL’s ambitions stretch beyond any single event or country. The Riyadh showcase isn’t just about one night of football in the desert; it’s part of a long-term push to transform a uniquely American game into a truly global sport. And with flag football poised to enter the Olympics, the stakes are far larger than a single exhibition. For the league, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic could mark the start of a new chapter – one where flag football becomes a global phenomenon and the NFL’s future is no longer confined to American shores and a handful of international games during the regular season. “This will be the ultimate celebration for football fans everywhere and introduce a whole new audience to America’s most popular game,” said Michael D Ratner, OBB Media Founder and CEO, in a press release. “Flag football is the fastest-growing sport in the world, and with [Olympics 2028] on the horizon, the timing couldn’t be better to showcase it on a global stage.” The NFL did not respond to a request for comment.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics,Sport,2025-10-15T09:00:32Z,1
sport/2025/oct/11/hull-kr-wigan-super-league-grand-final-rugby-league-match-report,Hull KR secure treble with dominant display against Wigan in Super League Grand Final,"As Joe Burgess raced away in the final moments to put the seal on an unprecedented season in Hull KR’s 143-year history, it was difficult to know where to look first as decades of frustration poured out all around Old Trafford. The Robins began the campaign as rugby league’s great bridesmaids. Without a major trophy in 40 years and with a litany of failures at the final hurdle, you wondered whether this talented group of players could ever shake off the tag of nearly men. That moment finally arrived earlier this summer when KR won the Challenge Cup but the one they really wanted was a first league title since 1985. Freed of the pressures of the past at last, Willie Peters and his side underlined in no uncertain terms on the biggest stage why Rovers are now Super League’s premier side. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Robins did to Wigan what Wigan have become accustomed to doing to opposition sides throughout their own era of dominance. After a nervy start, Rovers were far superior in almost every aspect and once they went ahead, they never looked like surrendering that advantage. Against a team as good as Wigan, that is about as high a compliment as you can pay them. The contest had already been decided by the time Burgess seared away in the closing minutes. Peters, the man who has masterminded this remarkable turnaround to drag a club who were bottom of the Super League as recently as 2020 to the treble, hugged almost every member of staff he could lay his hands on. The Rovers substitutes fell to their knees and the 20,000-plus KR fans, many of whom could have never imagined one trophy, let alone three, were sent into delirium. They are only the fifth club to win the Grand Final, with Leeds the last team to win it for the first time in 2004. There can be no complaints about the outcome, with Rovers sensational when it mattered most: producing the kind of display Wigan have done in the biggest games in recent years. “There’s only been four teams who’ve won the treble and nobody has won the treble twice, which tells you how hard it is,” Peters said. “They have been absolutely amazing.” The contest could and perhaps should have taken a very different outlook in the first half, but for some rare profligacy from Wigan as opportunities for Liam Farrell and Bevan French came and went. There was a fair argument to say it should have been 12-0 to Wigan and with their record in finals that would have been commanding. The game swung on a pivotal moment as Wigan’s Brad O’Neill was sent to the sin-bin after a dangerous tackle on Tyrone May. Within two minutes, Hull KR went ahead as the outstanding Mikey Lewis cut through to score between the posts. With O’Neill still off the field the Robins went further in front as a fine passage of play led to the former Wigan winger Burgess touching down. Rhyse Martin missed the conversion but suddenly, the reigning champions were scrambling. A penalty from Adam Keighran on the stroke of half-time got Wigan on the board and when Harry Smith scored shortly after the restart, a comeback appeared to be on the cards. But Hull KR quelled it as a penalty from Martin nudged their lead back out to six points. They then scored the decisive try as Jez Litten finished a fine move to leave Wigan behind by 12 and, quite frankly, shellshocked. This was an off-colour night from them, and they could have no complaints about the outcome, a point their head coach, Matt Peel, made post-match. “It’s tempting to look back on things we wish we’d done differently,” Peet said. “We didn’t do what we’d love to do but you’ve got to credit Hull KR for their energy in those periods. Full credit to them.” Wigan were bidding to secure a third successive Super League crown but this never felt like it would be their night – especially when it was revealed after the game that Hull KR’s hooker, Michael McIlorum, played through the pain with a fractured ankle. Burgess’s try with three minutes left merely confirmed what everyone had started to expect over the course of the evening: there is a new force in Super League at long last.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/11/hull-kr-wigan-super-league-grand-final-rugby-league-match-report,Sport,2025-10-11T19:04:38Z,1
sport/2025/oct/04/brisbane-broncos-dynasty-sunday-nrl-2025-grand-final-comment,I was born into the Broncos’ last dynasty but this Sunday could be the sweetest victory of all,"1992 was the finest year of my father’s life. In January, my mother miraculously gave birth to me. Dad wore a Brisbane Broncos beret to the Kingaroy hospital. Then, in late September, the Broncos beat the St George Dragons 28-8 to secure their first premiership. “Go! You! Good! Thing!” Dad roared at the TV as Allan Langer – “Alfie”, the star halfback and Broncos captain – scored a try under the black dot, en route to winning the Clive Churchill Medal. Alfie was the pint-sized prince of Queensland. His height and cheeky grin belied a will to win more like a Roman gladiator. He was also Dad’s nephew, my first cousin. Dad had offered him up to Sydney teams. “He’s too small,” was the response. In 1993, the Broncos won back-to-back against St George, while attracting average crowds of 40,000-plus. Alfie starred in a TV ad for Tip Top bread with my Auntie Rita. I carried around a Langer doll. Dad decked me from head to toe in maroon and yellow. For too long, the best Queenslanders were poached by rich Sydney teams. It was poetic justice that success should come with glitz, glamour and profit. But tribal passions ran deep. For diehard fans like Dad, the Broncos were Queensland’s team. They presented a long-awaited opportunity to get respect from “down south”. The Broncos won the 1997 Super League against the Sharks. It was my first live decider. Dad donned his trusty Broncos beret. The next year, he drove my siblings and me to Sydney for the grand final of the reunified NRL. The Broncos beat the Bulldogs 38-10. Sport taught me that ordinary people were capable of greatness. It also showed me life had limitations. In 1999, I began under-sevens. The Blaine rugby league gene skipped me. Meanwhile, the Broncos lost eight of their first 10 matches. Langer was so disgusted by mediocrity that he spontaneously retired. I persisted. In 2000, Kevin Walters captained the Broncos to a fifth title. In 2006, Darren Lockyer captained them to a sixth. But triumph breeds hubris. Shakespeare knew this to be true, and so do Broncos fans. They had never finished lower than eighth. Coach Wayne Bennett won six deciders from six attempts. Officials took him for granted. In 2009, Bennett left for St George-Illawarra. He won a premiership in his second season. That year, the Broncos ran 10th. My father died suddenly in September 2011. Langer was a pallbearer. The casket was covered with bouquets of maroon and yellow flowers. For a long time, Broncos games provoked mixed emotions. I waited for Dad to call before and after kick-off. *** Post-Bennett, the Broncos had become the very thing they were created to overthrow: the stagnant Establishment. The NRL was conquered by Queenslanders who slipped through their net. Cameron Smith, Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk found glory at the Melbourne Storm under Craig Bellamy. Johnathan Thurston – deemed too small by Broncos scouts – became a future immortal at the North Queensland Cowboys. The Broncos had lost the chip on their shoulder. So, they brought back Bennett. In the 2015 grand final, the Broncos led Thurston’s Cowboys 16-12 with seconds to go. But the Cowboys scored a try on the siren. Golden point. Life or death. Broncos’ halfback, Ben Hunt, dropped the ball off the kick-off. JT slotted a field goal to win. The Broncos – and their million-plus fans – were unfamiliar with the grief of grand final defeat. The squad never recovered. They hovered near the top, with no killer instinct. Bennett was sacked in theatrical circumstances, and replaced by Anthony Seibold. In 2020, the Broncos finished stone-dead last. Seibold was sacked. The faithful were shellshocked. Ex-players were apoplectic. They browbeat the board into making Kevin Walters the new coach. In 2023, the Broncos ran second. Reece Walsh, Ezra Mam and Kotoni Staggs evoked those bygone Broncos greats. So much speed and swagger. In the grand final against the Panthers, the Broncos took a 24-8 lead. We dreamed of deliverance from 2015. Alas, Nathan Cleary stunned with a virtuosic 20 minutes. The Panthers won their third straight premiership. They didn’t just thwart the start of a new Broncos dynasty, but eclipsed the old one. The glory days had never seemed so damned good or long ago. *** In 2024, an injury-plagued Broncos finished 12th. Walters was sacked. Walsh was accused of having tickets on himself. So, they hired a ticket inspector: Michael “Madge” Maguire. His record was chequered, with amazing highs and humiliating lows. Some Broncos old boys were dirty about sacking a favourite son for a southerner. The 2025 season was akin to Madge’s coaching career: starting hot, before hitting a trough, and finishing hot again. They snuck into the top four. In Canberra, Walsh was sinbinned for a headbutt. Then he delivered the most scintillating 20 minutes since Cleary in ’23. The Broncos were like Lazarus. They died twice, and twice came back to life. In golden point, Hunt – who else? – kicked the winning field goal. On the sidelines, I was juvenile with euphoria. This catharsis deepened two weeks later, when the Broncos revived from 14-0 down to end the Panthers’ dynasty in Brisbane. Payne Haas played like there were two of him on the field. With minutes left, Walsh threw a no-look pass to the wing, 14-14. The kick was converted. At Lang Park, even the grandmas went apeshit. Players described the atmosphere that day as akin to State of Origin. They were right. Brisbane Broncos fans are baying for success, in a way that wasn’t so deafening when it came more easily. It takes great agony to appreciate great ecstasy: in sport, and in life. I thought domestic responsibilities would make me less emotionally invested in rugby league. If anything, I am regressing. Watching this Broncos side makes me feel connected to my father, but not nostalgic. Walsh and Haas don’t feel like substitutes. They are singular, and potentially even better than what came before. Which takes us to a replay of the 2006 decider: Melbourne v Brisbane. Since that defeat, the Storm have appeared in nine more grand finals, and beaten the Broncos 34 times from 40 matches. Melbourne are now the merciless heavyweights. Maguire is a protege of Bellamy, like Bellamy was of Bennett. The Broncos are the plucky upstarts. They no longer take triumph or the city of Brisbane for granted. Their fans have a hard-won insight into the normal rollercoaster ride of most sporting sides. Which might just make Sunday night the sweetest victory of all.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/04/brisbane-broncos-dynasty-sunday-nrl-2025-grand-final-comment,Sport,2025-10-03T15:00:39Z,1
sport/2025/oct/01/jannik-sinner-learner-tien-first-title-since-wimbledon-china-open-triumph-tennis,Sonay Kartal pulls off biggest win of career to stun world No 5 Mirra Andreeva,"Sonay Kartal put together the best performance of her burgeoning career to outlast the world No 5 Mirra Andreeva across three gruelling sets, winning 7-5, 2-6, 7-5 after two hours and 25 minutes to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final at the China Open. The victory in Beijing marks Kartal’s first defeat of a top 10 opponent, a statement result as she rises up the rankings. Standing at just 5ft 4in (163cm) in a sport dominated by strong, imposing athletes, one of the most common questions surrounding Kartal’s career has been whether her game is too underpowered to trouble the elite. The Briton’s efforts on Wednesday provided a convincing answer to those questions. There have been signs throughout this week that Kartal was capable of such a result. She reached the fourth round in blistering form, rolling through her first three matches in Beijing without even coming close to dropping a set in a run that included a 6-3, 6-0 demolition of the WTA No 20, Daria Kasatkina. From the beginning, Kartal made life difficult for Andreeva, using her consistency, movement and discipline to drag the Russian into lengthy, gruelling exchanges and forcing Andreeva to earn every point. But Kartal was also bold with her heavy topspin forehand, opening up the court and constantly looking for opportunities to attack. She showed the full array of her game throughout the tussle, winning key points with drop shots and deft volleys while using her backhand slice well. Having put herself in contention for a notable upset, she remained composed in the decisive moments, recovering impressively after a tough second set to close out the win. Kartal will next face the 26th seed Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic in the quarter-final. Meanwhile, Jannik Sinner continued to piece together one of the greatest seasons of his career as he clinched his 21st career title at the China Open with a comfortable 6-2, 6-2 victory over Learner Tien. Sinner’s victory marks his third title of 2025 after winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year. The Italian’s record now stands at 42-5 (89%) this year and he has reached the final in seven of eight tournaments, including all four slams. Only Carlos Alcaraz has come close to Sinner on hard courts, with Sinner winning 79 of his last 80 matches on the surface against players besides the ATP No 1. Other than Alcaraz’s four hard court wins over Sinner during this period, Sinner’s loss to Andrey Rublev at the Canada Masters last year remains his only defeat on his favourite surface since November 2023. Despite the pair competing in different countries against different fields of opponents, this week has further underlined how superior Sinner and Alcaraz are to the rest of the tour. A day earlier, Alcaraz defeated Taylor Fritz to win his eighth title of the season in Tokyo. In the aftermath of his US Open defeat in New York, which led to the Italian losing the No 1 ranking he had held since June 2024, Sinner said he intended to make himself more unpredictable in his matches against his rivaleven though trying to make those changes could lead to more losses early on. The 24-year-old has shown some of those adjustments throughout this week, particularly by implementing more drop shots. Although he was not as dominant as in many of his other recent tournament runs, dropping sets to Terence Atmane and Alex de Minaur, Sinner still overpowered all opponents in his path. There is no rest for most of the best players in a gruelling season. The ATP Tour moves on to the Shanghai Masters, the penultimate ATP Masters 1000 event, where Sinner will has a first-round bye. Alcaraz, however, will not be present in China after withdrawing shortly after his win in Tokyo in order to manage an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Gaël Monfils has announced that he will retire after the 2026 season. Monfils, who became the oldest ATP champion in history in January and turned 39 last month, has enjoyed a celebrated 21-year career as one of the most charismatic players in the sport. The Frenchman reached a career-high ranking of No 6 in 2016 and has won 13 titles.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/01/jannik-sinner-learner-tien-first-title-since-wimbledon-china-open-triumph-tennis,Sport,2025-10-01T15:11:30Z,1
sport/2025/sep/25/kansas-city-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-nfl,The Chiefs have committed the greatest crime in sports: making Patrick Mahomes dull,"Patrick Mahomes has never been here before. Lose to the Ravens on Sunday, and his Kansas City Chiefs will sink to 1-3, falling further behind the Chargers in the AFC West, a division Kansas City have owned for nearly a decade. After three weeks of the season, it’s clear: these are not the Chiefs of old. And Mahomes, while still dazzling in moments, is not the irrepressible force he was three years ago. There is a different tenor about the Chiefs these days. At the peak of their championship run, they didn’t just beat opponents, they demoralized them. Their offense was explosive and creative. Putting up 30-plus points felt inevitable. Now, everything is a grind. Anything outside Mahomes freelancing looks like hard work. We’re into year two of the Chiefs being stodgy and methodical. The bombs away style of early Mahomes has made way for a more plodding approach as they look to paper over the cracks of a diminished roster. Many Chiefs fans won’t care – they will point to the glaring fact that the Chiefs made the Super Bowl last season, despite the fact that they lacked the fireworks of old. Rivals fans may welcome the struggles. Over the past few seasons, Mahomes and the Chiefs have gone from fun upstarts to villains. As well as their off-field failings, they have been overexposed. Their aging tight end is effectively the face of the league. They’ve been in primetime too long and have been the beneficiary of too many officiating calls. As the Chiefs have won and won and won, they have moved from a compelling sports story into a pop-cultural force. As the team’s cultural footprint has expanded, Mahomes has had to slog through the last two seasons. For most of his career, Mahomes has been different from other Hall of Fame-caliber quarterbacks. He played with a sense of childlike glee, as if he were discovering his own brilliance at the same time we were. There were the jaw-dropping throws, the how-did-he-do-it comebacks, 13 seconds, Jet Chip Wasp, fourth-and-nine, the no-look throws, the behind-the-back throw, winning the Super Bowl on one leg, the unimaginable made possible. Every week, it felt like he was discovering new ways to play the game. In the early Mahomes years, the Chiefs’ offense was thrilling and visceral. At its best – when the aggressive plays, speedy weapons, and up-tempo pace worked in unison – the offense was less about executing football plays and more about waging psychological warfare. There was no way to cover Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill. If opponents could stop the duo, Mahomes would buy time until one of them eventually sprang open. It was a parade of chunk plays. But as defenses have adapted to limit Mahomes’ ability to chuck the ball downfield, the Chiefs have leaned into a more restricted style. They’re happy to hold on to the ball, to piece together drives in five-yard increments. Last season, that was effective enough to make the Super Bowl again. But this year feels different. It looks different, too. Last year was a byproduct of poor roster management. KC bet on Kelce a year too long. Rookie Xavier Worthy took time to onboard in the Hill role. The left tackle spot was a sinkhole that corrupted the entire offensive line. Despite winning 15 games in the regular season, the Chiefs wheezed through 11 one-score games and didn’t total more than 30 points in a single game. The offense was a chore to watch, but they found a way. That was supposed to be a down year. In the offseason, they would regroup, retool and rediscover the old flair. But the same issues that undercut them a year ago are still present: Mahomes has no supporting run game to ease the pressure on him, his top-two wide receivers – Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice – are out, and Kelce continues to be the fulcrum of the offense at age 35. There is a lack of rhythm and synchronicity. A much-promised overhaul to last year’s scheme has yet to materialize. Defenses continue to crowd the middle of the field and dare Mahomes to be patient. Andy Reid’s counterpunch has been uninspired: grind out plays and hope Mahomes saves things late. This year, 65% of Mahomes’ throws have been below 10 yards, up from last year. He is getting rid of the ball a full half-second quicker than his career average, too, to offset his fragile offensive line. It’s the ordinariness that stings. Their defense is still masterminded by the brilliant Steve Spagnuolo but, on offense, the Chiefs sit below the Texans and Steelers in explosive play rate through three weeks. Mahomes’ best moments, those explosions of old, have come not through design but desperation. And Mahomes has been inconsistent, flashes of his genius tempered by basic miscues. He has played better than the box score would suggest. But he’s also left plenty of meat on the bone. Schlepping through games has at least revealed a new side to Mahomes. He’s in his defiant era. He is mean-mugging defenders after plays and lowering his shoulder in the open field to squeeze out an extra couple of yards. Asking Mahomes to drill a tackler was not worth the risk three years ago. Now, the Chiefs need him to fight for every yard. Winning a game with practice-squad receivers and a nonfunctional run game is, in itself, a testament to Mahomes’ greatness. He is duct-taping together competence; Mahomes leads the team in rushing yards and the league in quarterback scrambles. A late toss from Mahomes to Tyquan Thornton last week got the Chiefs’ season back on track. But slogging to a win against the hapless Giants is hardly the stuff of a true contender. In some ways, this is the natural life cycle of a dynasty. The Brady-Belichick Patriots won the Super Bowl in the 2004 season and didn’t claim another until the 2014 campaign. There were stretches of mediocrity, streaks where even Brady looked overwhelmed by age, coaching turnover, or a depleted supporting cast. But the greats bend reality and reset expectations. A bad year in Foxborough meant 11 wins and a divisional-round loss. Mahomes has spent his career living in that same rarefied air. Every season of his career as a starter has ended in an AFC Championship Game or a Super Bowl. With a salary cap and draft, no one can win every year. It’s to Mahomes’ credit that he was able to drag last year’s team to the Super Bowl. He seemed to be resetting expectations again. Even when the Chiefs look vulnerable, even when things aren’t clicking, they make it to the final game. Mahomes turned 30 last week. He left his 20s as the most decorated quarterback in history by that age: three Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl MVPs, two league MVPs, six Pro Bowl nods, two first-team All-Pro selections. He has been both a relentless winner and one of the sport’s great innovators. But as he’s turned 30, he’s entered the most trying period of his career. The Chiefs haven’t given him the tools to play at his melodic best, and he’s been forced to effort through games with an uncommon national glare. Soon enough, Rice and Worthy will return from suspension and injury respectively. And the Chiefs could be the Chiefs again – after all, the Patriots’ drought from 2004 to 2014 was followed by another two championships. But right now, they feel joyless, and so does Mahomes. There may be no greater sporting crime than making Mahomes dull.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/25/kansas-city-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-nfl,Sport,2025-09-25T12:21:49Z,1
sport/2025/sep/13/terence-crawford-canelo-alvarez-fight-report-undisputed,Terence Crawford stuns Canelo Álvarez to become undisputed super middleweight champion,"Terence Crawford made history on Saturday night in Las Vegas, outpointing Canelo Álvarez by unanimous decision to become the undisputed super-middleweight champion of the world. Before a record crowd of 70,482 at Allegiant Stadium – the largest boxing audience in the city’s history with a vast majority in support of Álvarez – the 37-year-old Crawford moved up two weight classes to hand the Mexican superstar only the third defeat of his career. The judges scored it 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113, all for Crawford, who improves to 42-0 with 31 knockouts. (The Guardian had it 118-110.) Already the first man of the four-belt era to unify titles in two weight classes, the Nebraskan now adds a third, an achievement without precedent in modern boxing. Having captured world titles in four divisions spanning 135lb to 154, he’s now added a fifth at 168. It elevates him from generational talent into the all-time realm of lionhearted weight-jumpers like Harry Greb, Henry Armstrong, Roberto Durán and Manny Pacquiao. The opening rounds were a high-level chess match brimming with tension between two master operators. The switch-hitting Crawford, boxing as a southpaw, worked behind his jab, matching Álvarez’s body shots before finding openings upstairs. By the middle rounds he was no longer just surviving the Mexican’s pressure but dictating the rhythm. Álvarez’s feet looked plodding, his jab uncertain, and too often he followed Crawford in straight lines, absorbing punishment without giving much back. The sixth round marked a turning point. Crawford began standing his ground in exchanges, landing sharp left hands and swelling the area under Álvarez’s right eye. From there the American grew bolder, befuddling his opponent with slippery lateral movement, planting his feet when he chose while out-throwing and out-landing the defending champion. The chants of “Ca-ne-lo!” that rang early were gradually met, and sometimes drowned out, by counter-chants of “Craw-ford!” Álvarez had his moments, especially to the body, but he never found a second gear or alternate plan of attack. By the ninth round he was visibly frustrated, lunging with single shots while Crawford picked him off with combinations. An accidental clash of heads briefly stopped the action, leaving Crawford with a cut that required stitches, but he grinned through it and went back to circling on his toes. In the championship rounds he was in total command, firing three-punch flurries, smiling at counters and even trading in the pocket without hesitation. “Canelo is a great champion,” Crawford said afterwards. “I’ve got to take my hat off to him. He’s a strong competitor. Like I said before, I’ve got nothing but respect for Canelo. I’m a big fan of Canelo and he fought like a champion today.” Asked about his future, he was noncommittal. “I don’t know. I’ve got to sit down with my team and talk about it. I’d just like to say thank you to all the supporters, thank you to all the haters. I appreciate all of y’all.” For Álvarez, 35, it was a sobering night. The four-division champion, entrenched at 168lb for nearly seven years, was at times made to look ordinary by the man from the smaller divisions whose timing and economy bridged the gap. He falls to 63-3-2, his first loss since he was outpointed by Dmitry Bivol in his own upward foray to light-heavyweight in 2022. The scale of the event underlined the scale of the achievement. Allegiant Stadium, the $2bn home of the NFL’s Raiders, had never hosted a fight prior to Saturday night. The crowd more than doubled the previous Las Vegas record of 29,214 set in 1982, when Larry Holmes battered Gerry Cooney to defend the heavyweight title in a temporary stadium raised in the Caesars Palace parking lot. Millions more watched on Netflix, which streamed the card at no extra cost to subscribers. For a sport long built on the pay-per-view model, it was a striking change: trading the money-churning paywall for scale, reach and spectacle. This was also the debut of Dana White’s Zuffa Boxing under TKO Holdings, backed by an ample investment from Saudi sports mangate Turki al-Sheikh, arriving amid political manoeuvering in Washington over a new Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act that could reshape the sport’s regulatory landscape. But the noise around business and politics was drowned out by the clarity and splendor of the main event. Crawford, who joins Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr as the only fighters to win a lineal championship in four different weight classes, has built his reputation on problem solving. Time and again he has taken a few rounds to download an opponent’s rhythm before flipping the geometry in his favour. He did it to Yuriorkis Gamboa, to Shawn Porter, to Errol Spence Jr. But after years of largely being denied opportunities against name-brand fighters and the mainstream recognition that comes with it, he did it again on Saturday against the sport’s biggest star, neutralizing Álvarez’s strengths, controlling the range and gradually tightening the screw. The scorecards reflected the closeness of the individual rounds but not the tenor of the action. By the final bell Álvarez looked weary and resigned to the outcome, swinging with hope rather than conviction. Crawford was fresh, elusive and in control of every exchange. For Álvarez, victory would have confirmed his supremacy at 168lb. Instead, it was Crawford who transformed his legacy. Not in a casino ballroom or half-full basketball arena, but before the largest fight crowd the city has ever seen, streamed into millions of homes around the world. The kid from Omaha who once survived a bullet to the head now stands as one of boxing’s all-time greats. On a Mexican Independence Day weekend all but purpose-built for Canelo Álvarez, it was Terence Crawford who stole the show and etched his place in fistic lore.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/13/terence-crawford-canelo-alvarez-fight-report-undisputed,Sport,2025-09-14T06:10:24Z,1
sport/2025/sep/11/nfl-panic-meter-is-russell-wilson-cooked-is-the-chiefs-golden-age-over,NFL panic meter: Is Russell Wilson cooked? Is the Chiefs’ golden age over?,"Russell Wilson Fun fact: the Giants returned 10 of their 11 offensive starters from last year, despite finishing 29th in EPA per play last season. The only change came at quarterback, with the Giants signing Russell Wilson, Jameis Winston, and trading up in the first round of the draft for Jaxson Dart. It was an odd strain of organisational arrogance: Ignore that we won three games! Our roster is great! Our coaching is great! Daniel Jones was the problem! Week 1 suggests otherwise. Jones is now with the Colts, and carved up the Dolphins’ defense, showing a level of confidence in his scheme and supporting cast that vanished in New York. Meanwhile, the sluggish Giants scored just six points against the Commanders, the fewest by any team in the opening week. Wilson looked like the same player he was in Pittsburgh: capable of throwing beautiful deep balls but offering little else. His athleticism has eroded to the point where he can no longer reliably break the pocket and create plays out of structure. Against the Commanders, he completed just two of 12 passes when pressured and was sacked twice. And when playing in structure, he was indecisive and late to deliver throws. Giants head coach Brian Daboll confirmed Wilson will remain the team’s starter for week two, despite teasing he might make a change. But how long can Daboll keep Dart out of the lineup? Dart flashed enough in preseason to earn the starting gig. Understandably, the Giants want to work the rookie in slowly rather than throwing him to the wolves. But the team’s decision-makers are on borrowed time. Their best chance at keeping their jobs is throwing Dart on the field, ready or not, and hoping for the best. That may not be great for Dart’s development, but it’s the Giants’ best shot at bringing a jolt to their limp offence. Panic meter: 8/10 – get your arm ready, Jaxson. Miami Dolphins The vibes have been off with the Dolphins since preseason. “It’s a great day,” Mike McDaniel said a month ago. Why? “Because we are another day closer to death.” McDaniel’s shtick is already wearing thin with the ‘Phins fanbase, and the end of his coaching run in Miami could be just a few weeks away. The reason why isn’t just the 33-8 scoreline at the hands of Indianapolis. It was how the Dolphins looked. You know things are miserable when Tyreek Hill is throwing his first tantrum of the season in the first quarter of the first game. McDaniel is a walking oxymoron: when was the last time a run-game guru was handed a franchise and the complaint was that his team was not physical enough? Usually, those coaches are portrayed as neanderthals, out of step with the new-fangled stuff. But under McDaniel, the Dolphins have been the opposite: wonderfully creative but committing the cardinal sin of playing soft. They can’t run the ball and they can’t stop it either. Their much-ballyhooed defensive front continues to struggle with injuries and failed to pressure Jones and the remade Colts offensive line. And despite all the pros with Tua Tagovailoa’s game, he is the least adaptable quarterback in the league. When pressure arrives or the offense is out of sorts, he bottoms out. The Dolphins lack the talent to cover up their shortfalls. McDaniel’s seat couldn’t be warmer. Panic meter: 10/10 – time to start scouting the 2026 draft. Bills defense I know, I know. The Bills engineered one of the most exhilarating comebacks in league history against the Ravens. As long as Josh Allen is standing upright, the Bills should be favourites to host the AFC championship game, particularly given the weakness of the AFC East. But outside Allen, alarm bells should be ringing. The Bills defense is a mess. They look small and light, incapable of standing up to a downhill rushing attack. No other team can roll out the combined threats of Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers, but what happened to the Bills on Sunday was as much about their own roster and structural flaws as Baltimore’s trifecta. If anything, it looks like the Bills built a defense specifically to stop Kansas City in January. The scars of multiple playoff defeats will do that to a team. But there are plenty of other threats in the postseason, and early evidence suggests the Chiefs may not be the team to beat. The Bills play more dime defence (six defensive backs) than any team in the league, but have one of the weakest safety groups. They invested heavily this offseason in versatile defensive linemen, players who could line up inside or outside to bring extra juice to last year’s rickety pass rush. This is a defense that is supposed to be as flexible and quick on third down as possible. But you still have to get the opponents to third down. And that could be a chore this year. Buffalo lacked the bodies to match up with Baltimore’s heavier personnel. The Ravens picked up 199 yards, averaging 14.2 yards per play with their bigger bodies on the field. When the Bills stuck to their preferred style of defense, rolling out extra defensive backs, Henry averaged 19 yards a carry. Sean McDermott has pivoted strategies at a time when the run game is experiencing a resurgence. Sure, against the Chiefs or Bengals, the Bills can flood the field with speed and be creative up front to pressure the pocket. But what if they see Baltimore again in the postseason, or the Chargers, or any run-centric offense? What if the game script isn’t in their favour? It was a problem last season, but Allen and the offense forced opponents into pass-heavy situations. The Bills doubled down on their approach in the offseason, and now they look out of place matching up against the top offenses in the AFC. Given Allen, the issue probably won’t reveal itself until the playoffs. But the Bills need to find reinforcements at safety and a veteran hand who can help thump against the run up front. Panic meter: 7/10 – the playoffs are all that matter, and additions are needed before then. The Chiefs in general Speaking of leaky defences, the Chiefs have problems of their own. They were ripped apart by Justin Herbert in Brazil. The Chargers ditched their typical run-based plan and instead allowed Herbert to fling the ball all over the field. The Chargers exposed faultlines across the Chiefs’ defense. The defensive backfield is as advertised: scrappy but lacking players who can hang in man coverage. But the larger concern is up front. Outside Chris Jones, the Chiefs don’t have a reliable pass rusher – and Jones didn’t turn up in Week 1. KC paid George Karlaftis $93m this offseason to be a reliable second banana, but he has never been more than a solid effort rusher who feeds on the scraps of Jones’s brilliance. If Jones is below his peak, the Chiefs are in a bind. Steve Spagnuolo is the best defensive coordinator in the sport, but he was left chasing his tail against Herbert. The Chiefs couldn’t reliably pressure with four, so Spagnuolo upped his blitz rate to try to manufacture disruption. But plugging more players into the pass rush left his secondary on islands, and Herbert gobbled it up, completing 11 of 14 passes for 178 yards and a touchdown against the blitz. Spagnuolo has proven time and again that he can make a serviceable unit out of ill-fitting parts. Still, his schematic wonkery can only drag the unit so far. Even if they approach league average, it won’t matter if the offence continues to stall. And with Rashee Rice suspended for five more games and Xavier Worthy hurt, it could be some time until the Chiefs offense is up and firing. Even dynastic teams have cycles. During the glory days of the Belichick-Brady Patriots dynasty, they had limp seasons. They would stumble into the postseason and exit early. The key building blocks can remain in place, but the ancillary pieces are no longer up to it, thanks to the salary cap, picking at the bottom of the draft order and misfiring on crucial free agents. The Chiefs have that feeling – a franchise caught between two eras. That doesn’t mean they won’t have a deep playoff run again – and it’s early in the season – but they have more holes to plug and questions to answer than at any point in the last eight years. Panic meter: 6/10 – lose to the Eagles in Week 2, and this jumps to 8/10. The Lions’ offensive line The Lions ran into a buzzsaw in Green Bay. They took on one of the best teams in the NFC, fresh off the trade for Micah Parsons, while replacing two coordinators. Teething problems were always going to be an issue. But the Packers exposed some fundamental flaws when the Lions faced the best of the best: they lack talent and depth along both lines of scrimmage. On the perimeter, the Lions have as much talent as any team in the league. Their offensive weapons are laughably good; their secondary is filled with game-breakers. But games are won and lost up front. The Packers bullied the Lions on both sides of the ball. Aidan Hutchinson is Detroit’s only dependable pass rusher, and any hopes to offset that deficit with the blitz fell woefully short against Jordan Love. A more pressing problem is the offensive line. Losing Ben Johnson was the talk of Detroit’s offseason. How would they cope without the hot-shot offensive mind at the controls? But that talk was always a little overstated; the loss of center Frank Ragnow – who decided to retire at the age of 29 – was a bigger deal. More than any other segment of a team, the offensive line functions as a unit; five gigantic bodies synchronising into a cohesive bloc within a confined area that offers little margin for error. Penei Sewell is a star at right tackle and Taylor Decker gives the Lions a serviceable starter on the left side. But the concern is with the interior. The Lions have turned the inside over to Graham Glasgow at center and young pups Christian Mahogany and Tate Ratledge at guard. Glasgow is a limited player, but Mahogany and Ratledge have talent. Yet the trio are not up to par with what Detroit has rolled with the last two seasons. All three are people-movers who can push defenders back off the ball. But all three also have limitations in pass protection and struggle to move in space. With Johnson and Ragnow, the Lions had the most varied rushing attack in the NFL, which helped fuel the league’s best play-action game. With the new interior, they’re limited in what they can call, and worse at what they do run. It’s going to take time to figure out what the offense can major in, time they cannot afford in the knife-fight of the NFC North. Jared Goff is an excellent quarterback when he’s sticking to the flow of a play. But move him off his spot, and he falls apart. Having a stellar receiving corps is fun, but it won’t matter if Goff is feeling heat or the Lions are unable to move the ball on the ground. Panic meter: 5/10 – beating the Bears this Sunday is now a must.",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/11/nfl-panic-meter-is-russell-wilson-cooked-is-the-chiefs-golden-age-over,Sport,2025-09-11T09:00:31Z,1
sport/2025/sep/05/alcaraz-too-strong-as-he-beats-djokovic-in-straight-sets-to-reach-us-open-final,Alcaraz too strong as he beats Djokovic in straight sets to reach US Open final,"By the final stages of a tense second-set tie-break, Novak Djokovic had left no stone unturned as he tried to cling on. He attempted to serve and volley, he threw in drop shots and vainly tried to take the first strike from his opponent. On more than one occasion, Djokovic’s miraculous defensive efforts drew 23,000 spectators to their feet. Yet this time, in this late stretch of his glorious career, he simply did not have the level to match one of the new standard bearers of the sport he has dominated for so long. Across the net, Carlos Alcaraz continued his imperious form by maintaining his composure and holding his nerve to return to the US Open final with a 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory. There was once a time when Alcaraz himself would frequently speak of the “rollercoasters” he would find himself on in matches, his tendency to pair his spectacular shotmaking with bewildering performances and to leave himself in unnecessarily protracted battles. By reaching a grand slam final without dropping a set for the first time, this victory further underlines how Alcaraz has evolved into such a reliable and dependable player this summer. He is in the form of his life, having now reached eight consecutive finals in addition to three consecutive major finals this year. At just 22, Alcaraz is the third youngest man in the open era to reach seven grand slam finals, behind only Björn Borg and Rafael Nadal. He now awaits Jannik Sinner or Félix Auger-Aliassime in the final. “It feels amazing, to be honest, it means a lot to me,” said Alcaraz. “It wasn’t the best level of the tournament for me but I kept a good level from the beginning until the last point. I served pretty well, which today I feel was really, really important.” For Djokovic, who had not competed since Wimbledon before this tournament, simply reaching a fourth grand slam semi-final in 2025 was an immense achievement. But with every physio appearance and physical struggle throughout this week, the strains of trying to compete at the highest level across the gruelling best-of-five-sets format at 38 years old has been as clear as ever. Despite being at such contrasting points in their careers, Djokovic and Alcaraz have spent the past few years battling as equals, with the Serb compiling a favourable head-to-head record and pulling off some of his most memorable wins against the Spaniard. This was their first meeting where the mileage in Djokovic’s legs was a clear impediment and despite how hard he fought and how deep he dug, the greatest player of all time just could not keep up. Coming into the semi-final, Alcaraz had been the player of the tournament so far, efficiently rolling through his matches with total focus and determination to waste no unnecessary energy. While Alcaraz was alert from the beginning, putting Djokovic under sustained pressure with the consistency and depth of his return of serve as he immediately broke, Djokovic was flat and erratic. Occasional moments of brilliance were counterbalanced by a consistent stream of sloppy mistakes. At 1-2 on Alcaraz’s serve, for example, Djokovic conjured up a stunning backhand down-the-line passing shot winner to drag the game back to deuce. He immediately followed that up with two missed second serve returns. Although he held and maintained his lead, Alcaraz looked tense and contained himself when they entered into baseline rallies. But he hit his spots brilliantly with his serve, which guided him comfortably through the rest of his service games in the opening set. A potential turning point came at the beginning of the second set as Djokovic forced himself into the match with a slick opening return game. He broke Alcaraz’s serve with a supreme defensive point, throwing up a perfect lob before drawing a backhand error from the Spaniard. It would only delay the inevitable. With Alcaraz’s superior weight of shot and athleticism, the gulf between them was stark in the moments when Alcaraz found his top level. Still, Djokovic fought as hard as ever. Despite the continuous pressure he endured in his service games, he found a way to pull himself through tight holds, somehow dragging himself into the tie-break. On another occasion during the earlier part of his career, Alcaraz may have offered Djokovic a lifeline with an erratic performance in the tie-break, but not this time. After Alcaraz closed out the second set, Djokovic immediately requested the trainer, who massaged the Serb’s neck during the change of ends. The final set was merely a formality. Over the years, the New York crowd has often been one of the most hostile audiences for Djokovic, and so one of the interesting developments in this latter part of his career has been the greater appreciation he has received from all audiences this year. Throughout the match, as he desperately fought to stay in the opening set, chants of “Nole, Nole!” rang around Arthur Ashe Stadium.

technology/2025/jan/01/muslim-friendly-websites-apps,Halal tech: how Muslim-friendly websites and apps blossomed in 2024,"Amany Killawi made a breakup playlist every time she was dumped, three in all. The playlists, which feature songs such as Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know and Apologize by OneRepublic, would make good soundtracks to romantic splits, but that’s not what they were. The playlists came together after Killawi was told by three different banks and payment processors they would no longer work with LaunchGood, the crowdfunding platform for the Muslim community she co-founded. Stripe said its banking partner instructed the company to cut ties with LaunchGood after five years of working with the crowdfunding platform. Stripe also told the company it couldn’t be associated with any international humanitarian work in sanctioned jurisdictions like Syria – a prerequisite for a crowdfunding platform that caters to the Muslim community. Another bank told the company there were too many Muslim and Arabic names and figuring out if those names belonged to sanctioned individuals was difficult. “People don’t realize Muhammad is the most sanctioned name,” Killawi, who was the chief operating officer at LaunchGood, said. With each dismissal, it felt like LaunchGood was on the brink of collapse. “If you can’t accept payments, you can’t exist as a company,” she said. There were few existing options that gave Killawi and her co-founders the stability and reliability they sought. So they did what a growing number of Muslim founders have done since: create their own solution. To mitigate the impact on the business if and when another bank decided to stop working with LaunchGood, Killawi and her co-founders Chris Blauvelt and Omar Hamid made the decision to establish a network of payment providers and banks to work with. Their hope was that there would no longer be one point of failure that could tank their business. When they were dumped by a bank, which continued to happen over the years, they had several backups. Now, more than 10 years since its founding, LaunchGood has become a household name and has enabled its largely Muslim user base to raise nearly $700m. While the platform also hosts personal fundraisers, LaunchGood is better known for its emphasis on charitable giving and has enabled its users to set up an automated donation for every day of the holy month of Ramadan. It has become the primary gateway for many during Ramadan, during which many Muslims donate to charities on a daily basis. The site’s rise and the challenges it has faced are not an anomaly. The “halal” consumer market, which includes halal food, financial services and other goods and services that cater to Muslims, has grown to an estimated $2tn globally, according to research and advisory firm Dinar Standard. Yet a 2022 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims were more likely than other faith groups to have their accounts at banks and other US financial institutions closed, investigated or otherwise challenged, with businesses effectively denying themselves access to Muslim customers. That’s why Killawi has stepped away from her day-to-day responsibilities as chief operating officer of LaunchGood to start a sister company, a payments processor called PayGood in 2024. She hopes to provide for Muslim businesses and charities what LaunchGood’s team had to hack together for themselves: a reliable payment system that doesn’t discriminate. “When [my co-founders and I] started out 11 years ago, we just wanted to build community,” Killawi said. “We never thought we’d have to become compliance experts. At some point it felt so existential. Can you even survive if you don’t have financial access in this world?” While LaunchGood was among the early entrants into the largely untapped Muslim-friendly tech space, its sister company is part of a growing class of tech and software companies that aim to cater to Muslims in the US, Canada and the UK. But what it means to be a Muslim-friendly business has started to shift since the 7 October attack by Hamas. Targeting Muslim consumers has always meant, to some degree, aligning with the ethics and values of the Muslim community – whether that was providing a halal-friendly dating app, interest-free loans or modest clothes. Now, this new crop of players that provide Muslim-friendly technology are also either overtly or implicitly working to address a growing demand among its intended customers: make it easier to stop contributing to Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. “What happened in Gaza this past year hit a very different nerve,” Killawi said. “Palestine is an evergreen issue for Muslims, but the level and scale of destruction of this past year was unlike any other. It accelerated this overall Islamic ecosystem and economy. There’s a new consciousness of people saying: ‘Let me really make sure I vote with my dollars.’” Even PayGood, which is still in beta, has begun to emerge as an alternative to major payments processors such as Stripe and PayPal as Muslims navigate whether these existing platforms align with their values. PayPal stopped provided services to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza in 2021. Muslim and pro-Palestinian founders have begun to question the leadership at Stripe. In late November, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison posted a picture from Tel Aviv – a move many took as tacit approval of the Israeli government and its actions. In the weeks since then, Killawi said she has had at least 20 calls with founders looking for a simple payments solution and alternative. “This is the most I’ve seen the Muslim community draw a line. They’re saying: ‘I want to put my money where my mouth is,’” Killawi said. “They feel ethically very conflicted. People just want to switch over to a product that aligns with their values.” The official movement to end international support for Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and siege of Gaza, called Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS), is nearly 20 years old. But in this past year, more Muslims took up the cause of spending their money in accordance with that movement. More companies are answering the community’s call for “BDS-safe” alternatives, and boycotting the major brands on the official BDS list is beginning to feel sustainable. The growing appetite for considered consumption is in part what inspired Adil Abbuthalha to start Boycat. In its current form, the app allows people to scan or search for brands to determine whether they have any ties to or involvement in activities that “support Israeli occupation, apartheid or violate Palestinian rights”. Abbuthalha has also launched a website that suggests alternatives to those brands when possible. Ultimately, Abbuthalha hopes the app will become the primary “ethical alternatives marketplace”, not just for issues relating to Palestine but all human rights violations. “To empower someone to make the right decision and vote with their wallet, we need to create a BDS-like tool that not only tells you what to avoid, it also tells you what to spend your money on instead,” Abbuthalha said. “We want to make ethical shopping effortless.” Without alternatives, divesting from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation is difficult. Yet when Nourin Abubaker and Yara Ourfali started a home-swapping platform called Makani Homes less than a year ago, they didn’t set out to create a pro-Palestinian alternative to Airbnb. They wanted to give Muslims more options that accommodated the community’s often shared preferences such as alcohol- or pork-free homes or homes with bidets. But the duo launched the platform at a time when many Muslims were looking to rely less on Airbnb after it reversed a ban on renting homes that were illegally built in the occupied West Bank. As of 2020, Airbnb had 200 listings in the West Bank, according to Amnesty International, which urged the company to “stop benefiting from illegal settlements built on stolen Palestinian land”. As Makani has expanded its offerings, the founders have become more comfortable positioning the app as a means to spend less money on companies that operate in the West Bank. The site, which until now exclusively offered its users the ability to swap homes, just launched a home rental service much like Airbnb’s. The company also organizes Muslim-friendly experiences. “Boycotting just got easier,” the subject line of a recent email introducing the company’s rental services read. The email goes on to talk about supporting a “community-driven business” instead of a “major travel corporation” that has listings in the occupied territories. “Our whole purpose is to let people know that just because companies exist and they’re huge doesn’t mean that you always have to give your money to them,” Abubaker said. Back in 2013, Killawi and her co-founders struggled to raise money to start LaunchGood. At the time, she says, few people were willing to take a bet on the Muslim community and even fewer on a Muslim-focused crowdfunding platform. In the years since then, investors have increasingly recognized the financial opportunity in backing Muslim-focused businesses. In 2017, a halal dating app, Muzz, became the first ever Muslim-centric app to be backed by Y Combinator. The halal investment platform Wahed has raised nearly $95m and was last valued at $300m. These companies have in many ways paved the path for startups such as Boycat and Makani, enabling a much less hostile fundraising environment for a Muslim-run company. And in the last year, as more in tech have become more active around the cause of Palestine, an infrastructure for pro-Palestinian companies has also materialized. Paul Biggar, who was kicked off the board of a company he founded after writing a pro-Palestinian blogpost, started an incubator called Tech for Palestine that aims to provide support for companies that are advocating in some way for Palestinian freedom. As of November, the incubator was supporting 36 projects including Boycat. While Tech for Palestine differs from a traditional incubator in some ways – it doesn’t provide funding at the moment and not all the companies it supports are startups – those running it provide startup-like advice focused on how to advance the goal of supporting the pro-Palestinian movement, Biggar said. “We’re trying to address the complicity of the tech industry in various different ways,” Biggar said. “The theme of everything we’re doing is supporting Palestine, either indirectly or directly.” Being outwardly pro-Palestinian has still presented some challenges. Abbuthalha said the vast majority of venture capital firms won’t go near Boycat, though it boasts a good deal of momentum. The app surpassed a million users in less than a year and has partnered with the official BDS movement. Despite the challenges Muslim-run and pro-Palestinian companies face, Killawi remains bullish about businesses that cater to the Muslim community. “The time is now,” she said. “It’s a lot easier to get things started today than when we first started. Just start small, it’s worth taking a bet on this community.”",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/01/muslim-friendly-websites-apps,Technology,2025-01-02T21:07:25Z,18
technology/2025/jun/11/big-tech-muslim-workers-gaza-israel,"As big tech grows more involved in Gaza, Muslim workers are wrestling with a spiritual crisis","Before Ibtihal Aboussad was fired by Microsoft for protesting the company’s work with the Israeli military during a celebration of the firm’s 50th anniversary, she sent two emails. The first went to all of her colleagues. She appealed to their universal humanity and urged them to stand against Microsoft’s contracts to provide cloud computing software and artificial intelligence products to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). She sent the second to the “Muslims at Microsoft” email list. Its subject line read: “Muslims of Microsoft, Our Code Kills Palestinians.” With her email, Aboussad told the Guardian, she wanted Muslim staff of companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon to stop regarding the question of whether they organize against their employer’s work with the IDF as an issue of secular or professional ethics. It was a question of Islam, of their faith, she argued. “I wanted to say, ‘Hey, remember, your rizq [livelihood] is from Allah,’” Aboussad said. “It should be clean, and you cannot be contributing to oppression.” There’s been protests within American tech companies against their contracts with Israel and its military since the start of the war in Gaza. There have been walkouts and vigils. Offices have been taken over and op-eds have been written. Some staff have resigned and some have been fired for their activism. But as the war endures and Palestinians in Gaza are being starved, forcibly displaced and killed, and the contracts have survived, there’s a growing group of Muslim staffers who are unsure whether they can religiously justify working at companies that they view as effectively defense contractors. The Guardian spoke with nearly a dozen Muslim employees of major tech companies who’ve been grappling with the question, many of whom asked not to be named for fear of professional repercussions or because they are continuing to organize inside the companies. Several of the staffers have resigned or are in the process of resigning. Some said they aren’t convinced that their employers have crossed a line that would force them to quit. Others worried that leaving the company would do more harm than good. Nearly all said that the public protest of Aboussad, and her co-demonstrator Vaniya Agrawal, has pressed the question. And at least for some, the footage of Aboussad – a hijab-clad young woman staring down Microsoft’s AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, and calling him a war profiteer – has been activating. Organizers at No Azure for Apartheid (NoAA), the worker-led group at Microsoft that Aboussad belongs to, and whose name refers to Microsoft’s cloud-computing platform, say that they’ve heard from more staffers looking to get involved with the group since Aboussad’s action. And they’ve heard from more than a dozen workers looking to resign or lodge a protest, and several more who have already done so. Others are on the fence, with some in a constant spiritual crisis over whether they should resign. The reasons vary: some feel they can do more to agitate against these contracts from inside the company, others worry about being able to provide for their families and some worry about trying to find another tech job in a tough market. “Honestly, I’ve been praying about what Allah wants me to do,” one Microsoft employee said. “Because it doesn’t seem like it’s right for a Muslim to continue working for such companies. But if we leave, then there could be a pro-Israeli person who takes our spot, and then you’re not serving the cause by doing this.” One Google worker said they decided it no longer feels halal to remain at the company. But their father doesn’t agree: he argues it’s their “Islamic duty” to stay at the company because the role was a blessing from God. “He said this is self-sabotage,” the worker said. “My parents are like, ‘If you quit, how does that help the cause?’ I don’t think they understand that by quitting I am not trying to help the cause,” the Google staffer said. “I’m at a [spiritual and moral] negative right now. I’m just trying to go back to neutral. Every day my work is actively harming people. I can’t help people if I’m actively harming them.” The debate is not confined to the cafeterias of tech companies. Several tech workers said they have sought the spiritual insight of popular Islamic scholars, including Imam Omar Suleiman, the founding president of the Yaqeen Institute, a Texas-based Islamic research organization. Suleiman is actively engaging with Microsoft workers to help determine “if there’s any part of Microsoft that wouldn’t be considered complicit in this”, he said. The imam said he is still grappling with the question of whether and how urgently Muslims need to quit their tech jobs, leaving the workers to wrestle with it privately for now. “More fields of employment are complicated than not,” Suleiman said. “It’s not always as straightforward as someone that works at a liquor store. It’s someone that works at a grocery store [that sells alcohol].” Big tech’s rising role in the siege of Gaza Details of how big tech works with the IDF have long been murky, and many tech staffers had mostly accepted their employers’ denials or defenses of these contracts. But recently, evidence that the tech industry’s products have been used in Israel’s violent campaign in Gaza, which the UN has concluded is consistent with “the characteristics of genocide”, has been mounting. Microsoft deepened its ties with the Israeli military in the wake of Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks, according to a Guardian investigation reported in collaboration with +972 Magazine and Local Call, based in part on documents obtained by Drop Site News. Leaked documents indicated Microsoft has a “footprint in all major military infrastructures” in Israel. The Associated Press has also reported that Microsoft technology has aided in Israel’s surveillance of Palestinians. Microsoft has defended its contract with the IDF, saying that an internal investigation concluded the firm “found no evidence” that its technology was used by the IDF to target or harm people. Microsoft’s chief communications officer, Frank Shaw, reiterated those findings and said these reports “are not accurate”. “As we stated before in our blog, we have found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza,” he said in a statement. The company’s investigation did nothing to assuage workers. Hossam Nasr, an organizer with NoAA who was fired by Microsoft after organizing a vigil for Palestinians in 2024, argued there is no way to have an “ethical” contract with a military “whose leaders are wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes”. Google and Amazon both provide cloud services to the Israeli military and government under a $1.2bn agreement dubbed “Project Nimbus”. Google has maintained that its technology is not aimed at military work, but reporting suggests the tech giant provides cloud services as well as advanced AI and machine learning tools that directly equip the Israeli military with various features including image and object detection and analysis. Google and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. ‘If you do not organize, you must leave’ Many of the tech workers the Guardian spoke with said the recent revelations about the depth of their employers’ work with the IDF and the lack of sufficient response to worker opposition to the contracts felt like a mask-off moment, one that left little doubt about their employers’ roles in Israel’s offensive and even less hope that the companies might stop working with the Israeli military. In April, the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement, which seeks to use economic means to protest Israel’s occupation and siege of the Palestinian territories, added Microsoft to its list of companies to boycott, further pressing the issue for many Muslim tech workers. It was ultimately these revelations that moved Aboussad to stage her protest at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary event in April. But there were other factors: in addition to becoming involved with NoAA in February 2025, Aboussad had also started wearing hijab at the end of 2023, and she felt a new responsibility as someone who was more visibly Muslim to represent her faith appropriately and stand in opposition to the company’s contract with the IDF. In her email to Muslim staff, she included an essay written by Hasan Ibraheem, one of several Google workers fired for occupying the company’s New York office the year before. The essay was meant to serve as a “dire callout to our community”, Aboussad wrote in the email. “To my Muslim brothers and sisters, I offer this essay as a sincere naseeha [advice],” Ibraheem’s essay began. Then he quoted from the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): “Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart – and that is the weakest of faith.” Ibraheem’s message was simple: Muslims have a religious obligation to stop oppression wherever they see it. Working at a company that contracts with the Israeli government as it continues its decimation of Gaza without doing anything to push back against those contracts was in violation of that obligation. Put bluntly, Muslims have two options, Ibraheem said: to either fight or quit. “If you do not organize, you must leave,” Ibraheem wrote. “And even if you organize, your goal should be to eventually leave. Organizing does not absolve you of complicity indefinitely.” “If you know that the company you work for is directly enabling harmful activities, then maybe your money is not completely halal,” Ibraheem said. Aboussad said that in the days after she protested in the meeting, she received dozens of direct messages on Instagram from other Muslim tech workers. Many said she inspired them to do more to oppose their company’s actions, and some said they were even thinking of resigning, Aboussad recalled. One person said her demonstration “removed any excuses” they might have made about not doing more to oppose their employers’ work with the IDF. One confrontation inspires multiple resignations The debates aren’t limited to the companies’ US offices. For some workers at Microsoft’s offices across the Middle East and north Africa, Aboussad and Agrawal’s protest was one of the first times they were confronted with the depth of their employers’ work with the Israeli military. For others, their concerns about their roles at the company had long been brewing. One worker, based out of Microsoft’s Cairo office, told the Guardian she had been weary for months of what she saw as a vehement pro-Israeli stance in Microsoft’s internal communications to employees and their lack of mention of the now more than 50,000 Palestinians who have been killed by the IDF. The first time she began to wonder whether she belonged at Microsoft as a Muslim was when the company fired Nasr and another worker after the two organized a vigil for Palestinians. Aboussad and Agrawal’s protest about six months later helped her answer that question, she said. Their demonstration prompted about 100 employees in the Cairo office to take a day off in protest of Microsoft’s work with Israel – an action that was just shy of striking, which is generally illegal in Egypt. On that day, she decided she would quit. “The response of [Suleyman] and [Microsoft CEO] Satya [Nadella] was very dismissive,” she said. “And I think Satya laughed, and that sort of made me feel like, no, I don’t think I belong here, and me staying here is just supporting what they’re doing.” None of the Google or Microsoft workers who spoke to the Guardian had any doubt about whether their employers were contributing to Israeli military operations. But some held out hope the company may switch strategies. One person who has worked at Microsoft for nearly a dozen years said they felt betrayed by the company, which sold them on its 2014 mission of “empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more”. But they remain hopeful that internal pressure might force the company to change its policy on working with the Israeli government. “I know during South African apartheid, the company did flip to the right side,” they said, citing Microsoft’s decision to leave South Africa in 1986 in response to the country’s laws enforcing racial discrimination. “I hope that history repeats itself and they become the company where the culture is that you make everyone feel great.” Meanwhile, workers’ protests have continued. At Microsoft, NoAA has disrupted at least two more company events, prompting the company to fire at least one of the workers, Joe Lopez. Another staffer, senior UX designer Jasmina Mathieu, resigned publicly, stating in an email to leadership and employees that she could no longer work at a company that directly or indirectly enables “horrific actions done by Israel”. Since then, the Microsoft staffers said, they can no longer send emails to anyone, including human resources, that contained the words “genocide”, “Gaza”, “Palestine” or even “Vaniya Agrawal”. One worker with NoAA, Nisreen Jaradat, was able to get around the block and send an email to all Microsoft staff decrying the policy that “utterly and completely discriminate[s] against an entire nation, an entire people, and an entire community”. Jaradat called on her co-workers to either organize against the company’s work with the IDF or quit. “If you choose to leave Microsoft to no longer be complicit in genocide do not go quietly,” Jaradat wrote. A popular imam fields the question: is working in big tech haram? Many workers have consulted with local religious leaders and scholars but have not been given a clear response. “We’ve been wanting to get an opinion that says, you know, ‘Just quit, you should not be working here,’ but we did not,” one Microsoft worker said. “They just say it depends on the situation.” Imam Omar Suleiman has been helping people figure out whether working at certain companies is halal or permissible for the entire 20 years he’s been a religious leader. Over the last two years, Muslims tech workers from around the country have reached out to Suleiman’s Yaqeen Institute with the same question: can I still work at a tech company that is helping power the Israeli military? For Suleiman, tech has been one of the hardest fields to navigate “because you have Muslims that work at various levels and tech companies are involved in this genocide to varying extents”, he said. What Suleiman and the Yaqeen Institute – where Aboussad now works – ultimately decide matters a great deal to tech workers of a certain age. The institute is well regarded among millennial Muslims in the US for its easy-to-digest content on how to understand and apply the teachings of the Qur’an. Suleiman’s videos have garnered him more than 3 million Instagram followers. Nearly every tech worker who the Guardian spoke to cited Suleiman’s speeches shared on social media as inspiration for why they want to leave Google or Microsoft. Yet for Suleiman, who recently gave an impassioned speech, or khutbah, at a Virginia mosque urging congregants to “have some dignity” and quit their jobs at arms manufacturers, whether Islam requires that these tech workers leave their jobs with the same urgency is still an open question. Like Suleiman’s example of a clerk at a grocery store selling alcohol alongside fruits and vegetables, it is not as clearcut if coding productivity tools poses the same grave transgression as building a bomb. Suleiman and others at the Yaqeen Institute are working on developing a general framework that will help Muslims decide whether they can religiously justify working at any of the tech firms contracting with the IDF. That framework will be published as a resource for both local imams as well as individuals in the midst of a spiritual crisis about their jobs. Suleiman looks at cases from many different sides. Staff have to ask themselves personal questions. Islamic religious law advises all Muslims to leave something that causes them doubt for something that doesn’t. But, he cautions, many cases are complicated. You might be the primary breadwinner of your household, have an employer-sponsored visa or be working at a part of the company that you feel doesn’t have anything to do with the products the firm builds for militaries, such as LinkedIn. One also has to evaluate whether you’re having a positive impact by staying in the company. “There’s room for the person who holds back the hand of the pharaoh from inside the pharaoh’s court,” Suleiman said. “But they have to demonstrate how exactly [they are] minimizing that harm without at any point becoming a mouthpiece for oppression.” And they need to evaluate the workings of their companies, he said. Do they produce haram, or impermissible, products, like alcohol or weapons used to kill people? In those cases, “they need to leave their job and they need to find a different job depending on what layer they participate in and how much need they have”, Suleiman said. Or is the company based around usury or interest-based transactions, which are also impermissible in Islam? In those cases, you can still work at the company, but you should up your charity to offset those haram transactions. While Islamic jurisprudence has an established structure to make these decisions, Suleiman says tech remains a complicated matter to locate within that framework. The imam said he is still in the discovery phase on how the roles workers find themselves in at these companies align with their religious duty. “It’s very hard to compare something that’s just purely generating weapons of mass destruction and a tech company that has a wide array of businesses, but also happens to be manufacturing for a genocide,” he said. “It’s hard for me to figure out when that line disappears.” • This article was amended on 20 June 2025 to correct the spelling of Nisreen Jaradat’s first name.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/11/big-tech-muslim-workers-gaza-israel,Technology,2025-06-11T12:00:27Z,11
technology/2025/oct/12/meta-ai-adviser-robby-starbuck,"Meta AI adviser spreads disinformation about shootings, vaccines and trans people","A prominent anti-DEI campaigner appointed by Meta in August as an adviser on AI bias has spent the weeks since his appointment spreading disinformation about shootings, transgender people, vaccines, crime, and protests. Robby Starbuck, 36, of Nashville, was appointed in August as an adviser by Meta – owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other tech platforms – in an August lawsuit settlement. Since his appointment, Starbuck has baselessly claimed that individual shooters in the US were motivated by leftist ideology, described faith-based protest groups as communists, and without evidence tied Democratic lawmakers to murders. Starbuck’s online posts have not changed in tenor since the “anti-DEI agitator” was brought into the Meta fold, and his Trump administration connections raise broader questions about the extent to which corporate America has capitulated to the Maga movement. The Guardian repeatedly contacted Meta for comment on Starbuck’s role, and his rhetoric online, but received no response. The Guardian also contacted Starbuck via an email address associated with his website. In part, he responded: “It seems your piece is an attempted hit job meant to punish Meta for working with me on AI fairness. Nothing I’ve said has been on behalf of Meta – they work with people from every political background.” He added: “My role is simple: work to make AI fair for everyone, regardless of their views. That’s a goal anyone who believes in fairness should support. What you’re really trying here looks like cancel culture and activism dressed up as journalism, and I won’t cower for holding the same views as the political party that won the popular vote less than a year ago in America.” Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said: “It is appalling that Robby Starbuck was given a hand in Meta operations in any capacity. He peddles lies and pushes extremism, and it is hard to believe any of this will help make their platforms safer or better.” Eric Bloem, vice-president of corporate citizenship at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said: “People should be able to find safe, welcoming communities online. Robby Starbuck pushes a dangerous anti-LGBTQ agenda, spreading disinformation and denying the very existence of transgender people.” Starbuck’s appointment to Meta via lawsuit Starbuck, formerly a music video director, has gained attention as an opponent of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. His pressure campaigns have frequently been directed at companies who are perceived as having conservative customer bases, and have induced major American firms to abandon internal DEI measures, or to end their relationships with pro-LGBTQ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign. Starbuck won his role in the aftermath of one such campaign. In the midst of a summer 2024 campaign aimed at motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, Starbuck threatened Meta with a lawsuit over claims its Meta AI chatbot apparently made about him. In August 2024, Starbuck posted a screenshot purporting to show Meta AI’s summary of a Facebook thread of Harley riders angry that the “company chose to go woke “. A screenshot in reply from a Harley-Davidson dealer appeared to show Meta AI asserting that Starbuck was, among other things, an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and had participated in the January 6 attack at the Capitol. Starbuck responded: “Wow thanks for sending, Meta will hear from my lawyers since I was never at J6 and have been a longtime critic of QAnon.” That lawsuit was filed last April. Starbuck’s appointment to work with Meta was part of the settlement. Other details of the settlement – including whether or not Starbuck was paid or is receiving ongoing compensation for the role – were not made public. On 8 August, Meta’s chief of global affairs Joel Kaplan posted on X a joint statement with Starbuck. In part, the statement read: “Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias.” The statement continued: “Building on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries.” Bloem said: “There’s nothing unbiased about [Starbuck’s appointment].” He added: “Coupled with its January rollback of protections against hate speech across its platforms, this decision calls into question Meta’s commitment to keeping LGBTQ+ people and others safe online.” ‘Portland is working with the terrorists’ Starbuck has long pushed vaccine disinformation, and he has amplified false claims made by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. In July, he boosted a debunked claim made by Kennedy in an interview with Tucker Carlson, in which he claimed that hepatitis B vaccinations led to a 1,135% increase in autism risk, adding: “This is absolutely criminal. The people behind this belong in jail and the hep B shot should be pulled immediately from the childhood vaccine schedule.” As part of his anti-DEI push, Starbuck has also spread overheated claims and falsehoods about transgender and LGBTQ people. He has also boosted such claims made by members of the Trump administration. In March, boosting a claim Donald Trump made in an address to Congress that the government had spent “$8m for making mice transgender”, Starbuck wrote: “Democrats are trying to pretend that Trump was wrong about the government funding a study to turn mice transgender. He was NOT wrong. This is the study and it’s vile. Eighty female mice were ‘sacrificed’ after their last injection. Democrats funded this.” In fact, the mice studies sought to gauge the effect of hormone therapy on maladies such as wound-healing, HIV, and infertility. Starbuck’s online demeanor has continued largely unchanged since he was appointed, with him backing far-right figures in America and around the world and posting dubious pro-Trump narratives. Starbuck recently expressed support for authoritarians and he posted a video of Stephen Miller’s speech on the Memphis Safe Task Force, which has seen federal officers and national guard troops making arrests in there. Starbuck added the caption: “I’ve been advocating for us to make Memphis safe again for YEARS now by carrying out similar initiatives @nayibbukele executed successfully in El Salvador and finally… It’s happening.” El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, self-styled as the “world’s coolest dictator”, is celebrated by the far right in the US for his unconstitutional crackdown, which has seen up to more than 1.5% of the country’s population imprisoned, almost a quarter of those without trial, according to World Prison Brief. Starbuck also baselessly asserted that city officials in Portland were working with anti-fascists, and appeared to urge a violent response. Starbuck claimed that injuries to rightwing online personality Katie Daviscourt indicated that “the leftist government in Portland is working with the terrorists”, adding: “It’s time to treat Antifa cells like we would treat Isis cells.” In a comment on this allegation, Starbuck wrote: “The record is not in dispute. Portland councillors Angelita Morillo and Candace Avalos both publicly defended an antifa activist charged with assaulting a federal officer. Morillo has even posted tips to help antifa evade law enforcement. “ He added: “When elected officials openly side with violent extremists, they are enabling them.” Morillo told the Guardian: “When influencers like Robby refer to ‘terrorists’, I’m not sure who they’re talking about – the guy in the frog suit? The people doing the Cha-Cha Slide outside the Ice facility in Portland? I can’t take anyone seriously who relies on sensationalized clips, AI content and outright lies to inform their thinking.” Avalos said: “People are free to say what they like on social media. That doesn’t make their statements true, and it doesn’t mean we have to take them at face value. “As a federal judge found in her recent ruling against the administration, the idea that there are coordinated attacks from ‘antifa, and other domestic terrorists’, as Trump alleged on Truth Social, is simply ‘untethered to the facts’. Who should we listen to: a sitting federal judge or someone with a Twitter account?” She added: “When I advise my constituents on how to protect themselves from federal agents acting unlawfully, I am speaking to the vast majority of Portlanders, who rightfully oppose fascism and are certainly not terrorists.” Starbuck also claimed that a high profile Trump detainee who was once incarcerated in Bukele’s brutal Cecot prison that “Kilmar Abrego Garcia [is] almost certainly an MS-13 member”. Two federal judges this year rejected the administration’s claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS13, and the government was ordered to facilitate his return from El Salvador. Commenting on his allegation, Starbuck wrote: “This is simple: an immigration court, DHS, and the president of the United States all identified Garcia as an MS-13 member. Denying it is no longer reporting – it’s spin in the pursuit of your own make-believe narrative. So once again, my language was perfectly appropriate.” ‘This is domestic terrorism’ In recent weeks, Starbuck has energetically attempted to connect the alleged perpetrators of high-profile shootings to the Democratic party. These claims culminated in a video posted to X in which he claimed that “in less than 2 weeks there have been 5 domestic terrorism attacks by leftists”, citing the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the armed attack on an ABC affiliate in Sacramento, California; the attack on a wedding reception in Nashua, New Hampshire; and the attack on an Ice facility in Dallas. Another example he offered were purported chants of “Fuck Charlie Kirk!” by leftists in New York in the wake of Kirk’s death. In an earlier post, he cited the same events and claimed: “This is domestic terrorism”. The man accused of the Sacramento ABC attack does have a long history of posting anti-Trump messages on social media, according to prosecutors, and spent two decades as “a lobbyist for healthcare, tribal and labor interests”, according to the New York Times. Evidence for connections between the other perpetrators and the Democratic party, or even the broader left, is either tenuous or non-existent. The claim about chanting demonstrators appears to arise from mid-September videos of counterprotesters who, according to videos taken by independent journalists, disrupted a memorial vigil for Charlie Kirk in New York’s Washington Square. The identities, allegiances, and organizational affiliations of the counterprotesters are unspecified, and few media outlets reported on the story except Russian outlet Pravda. However, Joshua Jahn, who turned his gun on himself after the Dallas Ice attack, was reportedly registered as an independent in Oklahoma, and was described by friends as someone with “a vaguely libertarian bent who despised both major parties and politicians generally, including Trump, but who didn’t engage with politics beyond that”, according to reporting by journalist Ken Klippenstein. Hunter Nadeau, accused of killing one and wounding two others in an attack on a country club in Nashua, New Hampshire, reportedly yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack. But state attorney general John Formella said Nadeau “made a number of statements during the shooting and appeared to be attempting to cause chaos in the moment as opposed to showing a hate-based motivation”, according to NPR. Formella added: “We don’t have any evidence to indicate that this was a hate-based act.” Tyler Robinson, the man accused of Charlie Kirk’s murder, was reportedly registered as a non-partisan voter in Utah, although family members indicated he had moved politically to the left, according to prosecutors. Nevertheless, investigators reportedly told NBC News that “thus far, there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any leftwing groups”. All of the reporting clouding the political allegiances of the shooters was on the public record on 25 September, when Starbuck replied to an X user who challenged him that “every single one of the cases I just pointed out are leftists”, blaming “left wing leaders … and their crazy followers”. Starbuck reiterated his claims about each shooter to the Guardian and linked to four sources he claimed supported him, including a Daily Mail story about Facebook posts by Joshua Jahn’s mother, and a protest footage video published to YouTube by one of the previously cited independent videographers. He further responded with accusations about the Guardian, writing: “Why is the Guardian fixated on trying to downplay leftwing violence instead of investigating the clear surge of it?” He added: “I don’t have the luxury of ignoring this reality – my security team and the FBI are actively handling ongoing death threats against me. The dismissiveness from outlets like yours makes you complicit in emboldening this violence.” Meta adviser The lawsuit that took Starbuck to Meta was carried out by a firm with Trump administration connections. Dhillon Law Group (DLG) filed suit in Delaware on behalf of Starbuck. In a press release, the firm said Meta’s chatbot had made “provably false and defamatory statements” about Starbuck. Between the original posts and the lawsuit, DLG founder Harmeet Dhillon was nominated and confirmed as Donald Trump’s assistant attorney general for civil rights. Trump named her as his pick in December and she was confirmed in April, weeks before Starbuck’s settlement. According to Office of Government Ethics filings, Dhillon divested her ownership in Dhillon Law Group in the firm in favor of her brother, a non-equity partner in the firm. In her 27 February ethics agreement, however, Dhillon wrote that she would “retain an interest in a portion of future recovery in 21 contingency fee cases based upon a fixed percentage of compensation”. The Guardian contacted the justice department to ask whether Starbuck’s case was one of the 21 that Dhillon retained an interest in. Initially, an automated response warned that “during the current lapse in appropriations, this inbox will not be monitored on a regular basis”. A spokesperson subsequently responded in an email, writing: “AAG Dhillon does not currently have any role in cases involving Mr Starbuck and their relationship is one of friendship and former client.” The Guardian then asked whether or not she had a role in his case at the time it was settled in April. The spokesperson said no. The Guardian previously reported that Dhillon earned a six-figure salary as CEO of a nonprofit, the Center for American Liberty (CAL), according to filings from 2021, 2022 and 2023. During that period, Dhillon Law Group received more than $1.3m as a contractor to the organization over two years. Dhillon, several CAL clients and Dhillon Law attorneys also shared the services of the same Republican-aligned PR operative. During Dhillon’s leadership, the CAL pursued a myriad of culture-war lawsuits on behalf of rightwing influencers, “de-transitioners” and parents of transgender children, and churches that had been subject to California’s pandemic restrictions. Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “This is just another example of Meta caving to Trump and his allies, and bogus charges of political bias, and makes a mockery of fair content moderation on Meta’s various platforms.” Elsewhere in his comments to the Guardian, Starbuck wrote: “You should be honest with Guardian readers about the fact that you’ve been accused of extremely close ties with antifa.”",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/12/meta-ai-adviser-robby-starbuck,Technology,2025-10-12T12:00:52Z,6
technology/2025/may/31/the-workers-who-lost-their-jobs-to-ai-chatgpt,‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AI,"‘They called it an experiment aimed at younger audiences’ Mateusz Demski, 31, journalist, Kraków, Poland I’ve been a freelance journalist for 10 years, usually writing for magazines and websites about cinema. I presented a morning show on Radio Kraków twice a week for about two years. It was only one part of my work, but I really enjoyed it. It was about culture and cinema, and featured a range of people, from artists to activists. I remember interviewing Ukrainians about the Russian invasion for the first programme I presented, back in 2022. I was let go in August 2024, alongside a dozen co-workers who were also part-time. We were told the radio station was having financial problems. I was relatively OK with it, as I had other income streams. But a few months later I heard that Radio Kraków was launching programmes hosted by three AI characters. Each had AI-generated photographs, a biography and a specific personality. They called it an “experiment” aimed at younger audiences. One of the first shows they did was a live “interview” with Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, winner of the 1996 Nobel prize for literature, who had died 12 years earlier. What are the ethics of using the likeness of a dead person? Szymborska is a symbol of Polish intellectual culture, so it caused outrage. I couldn’t understand it: radio is created by people for other people. We cannot replace our experiences, emotions or voices with avatars. One of my colleagues who was laid off is queer. One of the new AI avatars was called Alex, a non-binary student and a “specialist” in queer subjects. In Poland, we are still fighting for queer rights, and as journalists it’s incumbent on us to have real representation when reporting on this. For my colleague and the LGBTQ+ community, it was shocking and damaging to hear their lived experience and knowledge being imitated by AI. Some of us who had been laid off started a petition against the station, calling for regulation and to get the AI shows taken off air. We got tens of thousands of people to sign – actors, journalists, artists, but also listeners. Hundreds of young people didn’t want to listen to an AI show. The station has since scrapped the avatars, largely because of the success of our campaign. It’s now student-run. The station claim this is about offering mentorship, but it’s also a cheaper alternative to hiring qualified journalists. I guess it’s better than AI, though. There are still no clear regulations covering its use in Poland. I’m not campaigning for regulation because I lost my job to AI: I’m campaigning because I’m worried about the ethics of all of this; about misinformation and deceiving listeners.I’m a realist – I’m not completely against AI. I think it can be used responsibly to do the boring bits of our job. But we can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence. * * * ‘Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced’ Lina Meilina, 30, illustrator, Bandung, Indonesia I’ve been drawing and painting since I was a kid. Even in kindergarten, I was doodling. By elementary school I was drawing comics and my teachers knew I had potential. I have strict, traditional parents who told me art wouldn’t make me any money, but I wanted to follow my dreams. Now I make anime-style illustrations, and most of my income comes from commissions: I draw bespoke characters for clients, and also create my own. Even before AI tools arrived, it wasn’t easy. Indonesia doesn’t take artists seriously and copyright laws are weak. I’ve seen people steal my work and put it on merch to sell on retail websites such as AliExpress. I have to get them taken down myself, screenshotting pages one by one to report them to the site’s admin. Now, AI makes it harder to prove ownership, because it can take your art and make slight changes, so it’s not a direct copy. I first learned about generative AI a few years ago, watching a YouTuber introduce viewers to the software Midjourney, which generates images based on prompts. He asked the program to produce an image in the style of comic book artist Alex Ross. The finished work was good, with Ross’s distinctive hyper-realistic style and colour palette. I remember thinking, “Oh shit, this is going to be a disaster.” Since last year, when AI really took off, my workload has plummeted. I used to get up to 15 commissions a month; now I get around five. People can take your art and feed it into an AI program to create work. A follower of mine recently used AI to portray my characters doing something inappropriate. I tried to report it, but the platform said it didn’t violate its copyright policy. One of the main platforms freelance artists use to get work recently launched a campaign called “Nobody cares if you use AI”, encouraging clients and artists to embrace AI tools. Well, I care, as do a lot of my colleagues. Even the Indonesian government is using AI art: they recently released a video promoting a scheme that provides free lunches for students. It’s a great initiative, but it breaks my heart that they used AI instead of commissioning a talented Indonesian artist. I used to work in a small studio as a storyboard artist for TV commercials. Since AI appeared, I’ve seen colleagues lose jobs because companies are using Midjourney. Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced – and pay in south-east Asia is already low. Maybe my mum was right that I shouldn’t be an artist. I’ve had to look for other sources of income – at the moment, I make cosplay props on commission. I love illustrating, but if I keep losing clients because of AI, I’ll probably go into prop-making full-time. * * * ‘I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs’ Annabel Beales, 49, copywriter, Southampton, UK I landed my dream job in 2023, writing content for a garden centre. I mostly did search engine optimisation, and wrote gardening tips for their magazine and blog. My colleagues were friendly and the hours were flexible. I’ve always loved reading and writing. I was brought up on a farm with no television, so I was always at the library, reading Judy Blume books. If I didn’t like the ending, I would rewrite it. But I never thought then that I could pursue writing as a career: where I’m from, it was hard to break into anything creative – people either worked as nurses or at the local car manufacturer. Even though I wanted to be a writer, my mum had always told me to have a back-up plan. Copywriting didn’t come to me straight away, so I did secretarial work for years, and admin roles in the public sector. I’d heard of some friends who needed a copywriter for their businesses, and I was interested in writing professionally, so I enrolled on an online course. It cost a month’s wages and took eight months to complete, but I enjoyed the creativity. I got the gardening centre job a few months later. I’d interview different experts to write blogs on topics such as growing potatoes or planting trees. I threw myself into it and passed my probation. Around eight months in, I noticed I was getting less work. One day, I overheard my boss saying to a colleague, “Just put it in ChatGPT.” The marketing department started to use it more often to write their blogs, and they were just asking me to proofread. I remember walking around the company’s beautiful gardens with my manager and asking him if AI would replace me, and he stressed that my job was safe. Six weeks later, I was called to a meeting with HR. They told me they were letting me go immediately. It was just before Christmas. Thankfully, I got a temp role doing admin work in January, but going back to that after having my dream writing job was devastating. The company’s website is sad to see now. It’s all AI-generated and factual – there’s no substance, or sense of actually enjoying gardening. AI scares the hell out of me. I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs. I’m now a PA in cancer research in the university sector. I feel more settled, but I regret going into copywriting. I got the job at the gardening centre at a time when my mum was terminally ill. I remember asking her whether I should take it, as it would mean I wouldn’t be able to spend as much time with her. She told me to follow my dreams and go for it. I thought I’d be there for years, working as a copywriter until I retired. Looking back, I wish I had spent more time with my mum instead. * * * ‘Listening to a series I’d recorded, I heard my character say a line – but it wasn’t my voice’ Richie Tavake, 31, voice actor, San Francisco, US I’ve spent 10 years training to be a voice actor. It takes skill – it’s my job to bring honesty to the story I tell. I recently played the main character, Jessie, in a survival video game. Jessie crash-lands on a snowy mountain – as his voice, I have to consider whether he’s injured, how he feels and the shock he’s in. My mum encouraged me to try acting classes while I was at university, as it was something I had always talked about doing. Immediately, I was hooked, and after a few semesters I decided to pursue it professionally. I started training seriously while taking customer service jobs to support myself. My first gig in a professional studio was an Animal Farm audio drama in 2023, in which I played Napoleon. It was a great experience to get mic’d up and perform with a whole cast. The effect of generative AI in my industry is something I’ve felt personally. Recently, I was listening to an audio drama series I’d recorded and heard my character say a line, but it wasn’t my voice. I hadn’t recorded that section. I contacted the producer, who told me he had input my voice into AI software to say the extra line. But he hadn’t asked my permission. I later found out he had uploaded my voice to a platform, allowing other producers to access it. I requested its removal, but it took me a week, and I had to speak to five people to get it done. The Screen Actors Guild, SAG-AFTRA, began a strike last year against certain major video games studios because voice actors were unhappy with the lack of protections against AI. Developers can record actors, then AI can use those initial chunks of audio to generate further recordings. Actors don’t get paid for any of the extra AI-generated stuff, and they lose their jobs. I’ve seen it happen. One client told me straight out that they have started using generative AI for their voices because it’s faster. But when characters are written and voiced well, people relate to them. Take Batman, who was voiced by the late Kevin Conroy in the animated series. People appreciated his work because he brought the character to life. When done right, people will value it and pay money for it. There is also the issue of diversity. I’m American-Samoan and I wouldn’t be happy to hear a Samoan voice generated by AI – it could be inaccurate and even offensive. It’s just a bunch of numbers and words imitating a culture I was brought up in. A great example of this is Ghost of Tsushima, a video game that’s based in Japan. All the cast were of Japanese heritage: they were in tune with the culture and they brought so much honesty to the story. AI can’t replicate that. It’s a machine; it doesn’t have that background and it never will. * * * ‘I never anticipated they’d get rid of me’ Jadun Sykes, 28, graphic designer, Wakefield, UK As a kid I was always arty – sketching, making Play-Doh sculptures. I studied game design and art at college, and went down an Adobe Photoshop rabbit hole. It was fun and I was good at it, so I decided to turn it into a career, starting at the company when I was 21. They sell a platform that creates landing pages and email layouts. I’d design the templates and do bespoke work for clients. When generative AI came along, the company was very vocal about using it as a tool to help clients get creative. As a company that sells digital automation, developments in AI fit them well. I knew they were introducing it to do things like writing emails and generating images, but I never anticipated they’d get rid of me: I’d been there six years and was their only graphic designer. My redundancy came totally out of the blue. One day, HR told me my role was no longer required as much of my work was being replaced by AI. I made a YouTube video about my experience. It went viral and I received hundreds of responses from graphic designers in the same boat, which made me realise I’m not the only victim – it’s happening globally, and it takes a huge mental toll. I went to college, I studied, I did six years of work. Was it all for nothing? After I was let go, I spent months looking for a job. I didn’t find work in graphic design, but did get a job as a content creator at a PC manufacturer. I make videos of the production line, interview staff members and do some social media. I’m not worried here: my employers don’t agree with replacing human roles with AI. I may use it to edit pictures but only to enhance something a human created – say, to remove cables in the back of a product image. We would never post an image entirely generated by AI, which is what my old company is doing. My advice to every graphic designer is to learn as many skills as possible.

technology/2025/jan/17/uk-tiktokers-us-audiences,UK TikTokers say goodbye to US followers as ban looms: ‘It’s a really beautiful community’,"If TikTok disappears from the US, it won’t just be its 170 million American users who will lose out. British TikTokers and business owners have told the Guardian they will also lose a sizeable chunk of their audiences after a ban. The video app has become a key gateway to Americans for the UK’s online video creators, who make a living from accruing views and making sponsored content deals. With the ban scheduled to take effect on Sunday, a US-sized hole will appear in the global userbase. “In English-speaking markets, a lot of creators have sizeable US audiences that follow them,” says Thomas Walters, chief executive of Billion Dollar Boy, a UK-based advertising agency that pairs blue-chip advertisers with creators and influencers. A ban would be “really sad” for creators who have “built audiences from nothing” on TikTok, he adds. The Guardian spoke to several UK-based creators and one entrepreneur who all say they will be affected by a ban. Jay Beech, 30, London Users in the US account for nearly half of Beech’s 1.7 million-strong audience on TikTok. He says there is a strong relationship between creators and users on both sides of the Atlantic, a form of digital cultural exchange that millions of Brits and Americans will miss. “It’s going to be a big difference for all of us, to see that gap in our feeds,” he says. Beech, who describes his posts as “high-energy fashion content”, says sponsored content – from brands such as the US skincare line Kiehl’s and Sky TV – provides the majority of his income. He also has a presence on YouTube Shorts and Instagram but says he has noticed that TikTok users “don’t necessarily follow you elsewhere”. “[A ban] will throw people out into this diaspora of trying to find their favourite creators again and finding a new home on whatever platform they choose,” he said. Fats Timbo, 28, Kent Fats is a comedian and disability activist who posts comedy, beauty and lifestyle content to her 3 million followers on TikTok. She says the platform’s US reach – approximately a quarter of her following – has been vital for her work. “TikTok is crucial for my career because it allows me to connect with a US audience, where representation of people like me – Black women with dwarfism – is often lacking,” she says. Timbo adds that the US offers creators like her a chance to “grow, collaborate, and be seen on a global stage”. “It’s not just about numbers. It’s about the impact I can have and the representation I can provide for people who rarely see someone like themselves in media. Losing that connection would feel like losing a part of my purpose,” she says. Timbo says her US audience is “key for securing brand deals, collaborations, and visibility on a global scale”. Losing TikTok in the US would be a “significant setback” but she is also creating content on Instagram to maintain her connection with her US followers. Em Wallbank, 25, West Yorkshire US viewers represent about 40% of Em Wallbank’s audience. The west Yorkshire-based creator says her comedy skits have been a hit across the Atlantic partly due to her accent. Wallbank, who is best known for posts riffing on Harry Potter characters, has 1.7 million followers on TikTok. “I think some of my popularity is because I am northern and my accent is a bit of a novelty [to US users],” she says. Wallbank, who started posting skits on TikTok in 2022, says the US social media market is a testing ground for a creator’s ability to build a broad career, like the Kardashians and Nicole Richie. “The ones that are having careers outside of social media, it is because they have attracted the attention of US audiences,” she said. Wallbank’s US popularity has resulted in her working at fan conventions in the US as well as creating sponsored content with multinationals like Disney+ in the UK. She is concerned for would-be creators who could use TikTok, and its US audience, to access a creative career that might otherwise have been out of reach. “To be able to get into a creative industry, with my background, is massive,” she says. Sarah Yuma, 30, London Yuma says a US TikTok audience has been crucial to the growth of her business, selling home and hair accessories using African fabrics. “It can be tricky building a business just relying on UK audiences. During lockdown it was the US audience that pushed my business and took it to the next level,” she says. Yuma, who has more than 3,000 followers on TikTok, says she had an influx of US customers and followers amid a surge in popularity for the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. TikTok disappearing from the US would mean “I would lose a huge chunk of my community,” says Yuma. “They have helped me with my designs. It’s a really beautiful community that I have created.” If TikTok is switched off in the US, she adds, she will need to rethink how she connects with an American audience. “I will have to rethink my strategy about how to keep them in my community and staying in contact with them,” she says. “ I don’t want to isolate them. They are really important to my business.” Sam Cornforth, 29, London Cornforth posts fitness-related comedy sketches to his 460,000 followers, with the US accounting for approximately a quarter of that total. He says his income from sponsored content will be protected by the fact that he works with UK-based brands like Argos. However, he says brands could react negatively to creators losing a sizable chunk of their audience. “Brands do pay attention to your total reach. If, potentially, 20% to 30% of that is cut, will that affect your future opportunities with those brands?” he asked. Cornforth adds that TikTok’s US audience is important for establishing trends that filter across other platforms. Without that influence, creators could lose an impetus and inspiration for their work. “It’s the birthplace for trends, and then they filter down to YouTube Shorts and Instagram at a later date,” he says. • This article was amended on 17 January 2025.

technology/2024/nov/26/far-right-weaponising-ai-generated-content-europe,How the far right is weaponising AI-generated content in Europe,"From fake images designed to cause fears of an immigrant “invasion” to other demonisation campaigns targeted at leaders such as Emmanuel Macron, far-right parties and activists across western Europe are at the forefront of the political weaponisation of generative artificial intelligence technology. This year’s European parliamentary elections were the launchpad for a rollout of AI-generated campaigning by the European far right, experts say, which has continued to proliferate since. This month, the issue reached the independent oversight board of Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta when the body opened an investigation into anti-immigration content on Facebook. The inquiry by the oversight board will look at a post from a German account featuring an AI-generated image emblazoned with anti-immigrant rhetoric. It is part of a wave of AI-made rightwing content on social media networks. Posts elsewhere from Europe’s political extremes range from the Italian far right’s deployment of “photo-realistic” images of women and children eating insects to bolster a conspiracy theory about the intentions of “a global elite”, to Irish far-right images of a police officer stamping on Ireland’s flag and Islamophobic memes in the immediate aftermath of the Southport knife murders in the UK. The use of the same models and themes and the same approach to presenting and packaging the images on social media platforms has given rise to a common aesthetic across borders, and in the EU and Britain. In virtually every case, far-right parties and movements have eschewed the use of any sort of watermarking or identifier on the AI images, according to experts. “What we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg because what is coming from individuals and beyond the official channels is even worse,” said Salvatore Romano, the head of research at the nonprofit AI Forensics, which examined the output of parties including France’s National Rally, Reconquête and Les Patriotes. William Allchorn, a senior research fellow at Anglia Ruskin University, said the ease of use of AI models was appealing to a political fringe that had shown an attitude of “pragmatic opportunism” to new technology. “AI lowers the barriers to entry for creating content. You don’t need coding skills or anything like that to generate these images. It is also symptomatic of far-right views going mainstream or being normalised,” he said, adding that the far right appeared to have fewer moral concerns about AI imagery. Allchorn said more established political parties appeared warier of using AI in official campaigns: “Mainstream actors still have ethical concerns about the effectiveness, authenticity and reliability of these models that far-right or extremist actors are not beholden to.” Germany The German far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party and supporters of its anti-immigrant stance have been avid users of AI image generators. The image under scrutiny by Meta’s content moderation board features a blond-haired, blue-eyed woman holding up her hand in a stop gesture, with a stop sign and German flag in the background. The text over the image says people should stop coming to Germany because the country does not need more “gang-rape specialists” due to the Green party’s immigration policy. In September, the AfD’s Brandenburg branch produced AI-made campaign adverts that contrast an idealised Germany featuring blond-haired and blue-eyed people with scenes of veiled women walking down streets and a person waving an LGBTQ+ flag. Reality Defender, a US-based deepfake detection firm, said the image could have been produced within minutes. Other pro-AfD groups on Facebook seen by the Guardian use AI images emblazoned with nativist or anti-immigrant slogans. Another shows a giant pig – an animal whose meat is prohibited from consumption in Islam – chasing a group of people in Islamic clothing, with the slogan “Arabic film version of Godzilla”. The UK In the aftermath of the Southport stabbings, when a teenager killed three young girls, AI was deployed to advertise protests and to post Islamophobic content, based on false assumptions about the identity of the alleged attacker. One image depicted bearded men in traditional Islamic dress outside parliament, with one waving a knife, behind a crying child in a union jack T-shirt. The tweet was captioned: “We must protect our children!” The far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has also appeared in AI-generated images and has the technology on his own social media accounts, including one post commemorating D-day that attracted derision because it showed second world war troops marching off the beach and into the sea. France Generative AI imagery was identified as an integral part of the campaign strategy of far-fight political parties during this year’s European and legislative elections in France. Posts on X included images of people approaching a beach on boats, emblazoned with an anti-immigration slogan, and videos criticising the president, Emmanuel Macron. “Only far-right parties consistently used AI-generated visuals to build their websites and represent photo-realistic events that never occurred, making this a distinctive and strategic element of their campaigns,” said Romano of AI Forensics. Ireland While Ireland has no successful far-right party mirroring those in other EU states, the use of generative AI surged among the country’s emergent far-right street movement after riots in Dublin in November 2023. A frequent meme has featured Conor McGregor, the former mixed martial arts star who has flirted with far-right language and whose anti-government and anti-migrant messaging resonated with far-right groups. Ciarán O’Connor, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said one particularly popular post on X depicted McGregor standing in front of a burning bus – an echo of one of the genuine images from the riots when a vehicle was torched in the city centre. The image was posted by the far-right UK group Britain First and later tweeted by McGregor himself before he deleted it. It received 20m views. Since then, O’Connor said generative AI had been used in support of anti-immigration protests and groups and to create content to depict specific scenes that appear to be aimed at evoking anti-migrant sentiments. A campaign by the small far-right Irish People party included a post on X where it acknowledged using an AI-generated image of a “supporter” saying they “hardly recognise” where they grew up. Italy In Italy, the populist Lega party published anti-trans and Islamophobic AI-generated images including a bearded pregnant man, a group of men in Arab-style clothing burning a copy of Dante’s Divine Comedy, and Macron posing as a fictional “EU soldier”, in a message with anti-EU overtones. The political adverts were published on Facebook and Instagram and on the social media accounts of Lega’s leader, Matteo Salvini. Other non-watermarked images on Salvini’s account include images of women and children eating insects, a reference to a popular rightwing conspiracy theory that the EU was preparing to make European citizens eat insect-based food.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/26/far-right-weaponising-ai-generated-content-europe,Technology,2024-11-26T05:00:03Z,5
technology/2025/jan/08/meta-scrapped-factcheckers-because-systems-were-too-complex,Meta scrapped factcheckers ‘because systems were too complex’,"The co-chair of Meta’s oversight board said the company’s systems had become “too complex”, as the chief executive of Elon Musk’s X welcomed its decision to scrap factcheckers. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the co-chair of the social media company’s oversight board and the former prime minister of Denmark, has said she and the departed president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, had agreed “Meta systems have been too complex”, adding that there had been “over-enforcement”. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg made the surprise announcement that the Facebook owner would move away from using third-party checkers to flag misleading content in favour of notes from other users. The 40-year-old billionaire said that, starting in the US, Meta would “get rid of factcheckers and replace them with community notes similar to X”, as the company moves to prioritise free speech in the run-up to Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The move came only days after Clegg, Britain’s former deputy prime minister, left Meta after six years at the company, most recently in the role of president of global affairs. In a departure post on Facebook, Clegg said he was proud of having worked on “new forms of governance”. During his time at Meta, he helped to establish the Facebook oversight board, an independent board that makes decisions on the social network’s moderation policies. Thorning-Schmidt told the BBC: “There are huge problems in what Mark Zuckerberg has announced yesterday and that’s why the existence of an oversight board is so important. We welcome looking into factchecking. We welcome that message, looking into the complexity and perhaps over-enforcement. “We’re very concerned about gender rights, LGBTQ+ rights, trans people’s rights on the platforms because we are seeing many instances where hate speech can lead to real-life harm, so we will be watching that space very carefully.” Clegg will be replaced by Joel Kaplan, who previously served as the deputy chief of staff for policy under the former president George W Bush, months after Trump’s election victory. Thorning-Schmidt said Clegg had “talked about leaving for a long time”. Her comments came as Linda Yaccarino, the head of X, welcomed Meta’s decision, saying “welcome to the party” during an appearance at the CES technology show in Las Vegas, hours after Zuckerberg announced the policy shift. The change will mean the social network moves away from third-party checkers to flag misleading content in favour of user-based notes. These have been introduced widely in recent years on X, formerly known as Twitter, particularly after Musk cut content moderators amid mass sackings after he bought the company in 2022. The decision by Meta, which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has been widely criticised by online safety campaigners and commentators, who said it would enable the flow of misinformation and harmful content. Yaccarino described Meta’s decision as “really exciting” during an onstage question and answer session at CES. She said X’s community notes were “good for the world” and the system was “the most effective, fastest factchecking, without bias”. She said: “Think about it as this global collective consciousness, keeping each other accountable at global scale in real time. And it couldn’t be more validating than to see that Mark and Meta realised that.” Yaccarino added: “Human behaviour is inspired because when a post is noted, it’s dramatically shared less, so that’s the power of community notes.” Wearing a rare Swiss watch, reportedly worth almost $900,000 (£722,607), Zuckerberg called Meta’s current moderation system “too politically biased”, although he admitted that changes to the way the company filtered content would mean “we’re going to catch less bad stuff”.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/08/meta-scrapped-factcheckers-because-systems-were-too-complex,Technology,2025-01-08T10:43:38Z,4
business/2024/sep/17/dating-app-feeld-personal-data-cybersecurity,Users of ‘throuples’ dating app Feeld may have had intimate photos accessed,"Users of Feeld, a dating app aimed at alternative relationships, could have had sensitive data including messages, private photos and details of their sexuality accessed or even edited, it has emerged, after cybersecurity experts exposed a string of security “vulnerabilities”. Feeld, registered in the UK, reported soaring revenues and profits this month, thanks to millions of downloads from non-monogamous, queer and kinky users across the world. But while the app has gone from strength to strength financially – and attracted plaudits for its approach to sexuality – a British cybersecurity company claims to have uncovered serious failings in Feeld’s systems earlier this year. Feeld said it had dealt with the concerns “as a matter of urgency”, resolved them within two months and that it had not seen any evidence that user data had been breached. It did not know how long the vulnerabilities had existed before it was told about them in March by the London-based cybersecurity firm Fortbridge. Fortbridge discovered the issues after “pentesting”, an industry term for security assessments of websites and apps to identify weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Its researchers found that it was possible to read other people’s messages exchanged in chats on Feeld and even see attachments, which can include sexually explicit pictures and videos. This could be done without using a Feeld account, as long as a potential hacker had the user’s “stream user ID”, potentially visible to anyone who could see their profile. Messages could be edited and deleted, the researchers found, and chats deleted by the users could be recovered. Time-limited photos and videos, commonly used to share explicit images that self-delete after one viewing, could be retrieved and seen indefinitely, by accessing a link available to the sender. Fortbridge said the failings could also allow a hacker to change someone else’s profile information, including their name, age and sexuality. It was also possible to view other people’s matches and to manually force one profile to “like” another. The cybersecurity company told the Guardian that the failings could have been exploited by someone with “basic technical knowledge”. Adrian Tiron, a managing partner at Fortbridge, said: “Although these aren’t the most sophisticated bugs we’ve found or exploited, they are certainly some of the most impactful due to Feeld’s large user base, putting a significant number of users at risk. “In the industry, it’s common practice for companies to share their best research with the community. We’ve learned a great deal from others by reading their reports, and now it’s our turn to give back. “We’ve noticed that many companies claim to prioritise security, but often these are just words – more action is needed.” Feeld said it had not shared information about the security flaws publicly, including with users, because it did not want to “invite bad actors” to manipulate private information. It said members would be told directly about how it had fixed the issues and that it was looking at sharing more “proactive updates” in future via its website, email and the app. Alex Lawrence-Archer, a solicitor at the data rights specialist law firm AWO, said Feeld could now face repercussions from the data regulator, the information commissioner’s office, or from any user whose information was found to have been accessed. “If this is right, that personal data, including messages and private photos, was exposed in this way – or even capable of being accessed – there’s a strong argument that it’s in beach of the core GDPR principle that data must be processed in a secure fashion,” he said. “It’s the kind of thing I’d expect the ICO to investigate, if accurate, to get to the bottom of what’s gone on and whether any remedial or enforcement action is warranted. “We don’t know if anyone’s photos or messages have been accessed. If it turned out that they had, such an individual would have cause of action against Feeld, for instance if they had suffered distress.” Lawrence-Archer said the security vulnerabilities also raised potential concerns about identification of LGBTQ+ people in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The ICO said it had not received reports of a data breach at Feeld. Feeld said it had not informed the regulator because it had seen no evidence that anyone had accessed private data and a third-party organisation had approved its decision not to self-report. The company said it had investigated the problems brought to its attention by Fortbridge on 3 March and fixed them by 28 May but had failed to communicate adequately to Fortbridge that the issues had been resolved and were being reviewed by a third party. It said no issues were outstanding, except for one that allowed non-members to access premium features, adding that it welcomed further pentesting. “Our members’ safety and security is our top priority, and we welcome ongoing collaboration with the ethical hacking community to identify vulnerabilities as this only strengthens our platform for the future,” said a spokesperson. It added that it had previously been unable to run the kind of tests on its systems that Fortbridge had done but was now able to do so.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/dating-app-feeld-personal-data-cybersecurity,Technology,2024-09-17T11:18:38Z,4
technology/article/2024/sep/05/racism-misogyny-lies-how-did-x-become-so-full-of-hatred-and-is-it-ethical-to-keep-using-it,"Racism, misogyny, lies: how did X become so full of hatred? And is it ethical to keep using it?","I considered leaving Twitter as soon as Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, just not wanting to be part of a community that could be bought, least of all by a man like him – the obnoxious “long hours at a high intensity” bullying of his staff began immediately. But I’ve had some of the most interesting conversations of my life on there, both randomly, ambling about, and solicited, for stories: “Anyone got catastrophically lonely during Covid?”; “Anyone hooked up with their secondary school boy/girlfriend?” We used to call it the place where you told the truth to strangers (Facebook was where you lied to your friends), and that wide-openness was reciprocal and gorgeous. It got more unpleasant after the blue-tick fiasco: identity verification became something you could buy, which destroyed the trust quotient. So I joined the rival platform Mastodon, but fast realised that I would never get 70,000 followers on there like I had on Twitter. It wasn’t that I wanted the attention per se, just that my gang wasn’t varied or noisy enough. There’s something eerie and a bit depressing about a social media feed that doesn’t refresh often enough, like walking into a shopping mall where half the shops have closed down and the rest are all selling the same thing. In 2023, the network now known as X began sharing ad revenues with its “premium” users, and I joined Threads (which is owned by Meta), but all I ever see on it is strangers confessing to boring misdemeanours. I remained on X, where everything got darker. People get paid, indirectly through advertising, for engagement. Even that is a bit murky, since it’s described as “revenue sharing”, but you don’t get to see which ads’ revenues were shared with you, so can’t measure revenue-per-impression. Is X sharing it 50/50? Or 10/90? Are they actually paying you to generate hatred? “What we’ve seen,” says Ed Saperia, dean of the London College of Political Technology, “is controversial content drives engagement. Extreme content drives engagement.” Creating toxic content became a viable livelihood, which my 16-year-old, on football X, noticed way before I did: people saying patently wrong things for hate-clicks. You might get a couple of thousand likes for noticing that David Cameron looks like Catherine the Great, but that’s nothing like the engagement you’ll get for attacking trans people, say. Those high-attention tweets go straight to the top of the For You feed, driven by a “black box algorithm designed to keep you scrolling”, as Rose Wang, COO of another rival, Bluesky, puts it, but the user experience is screeds of repetition on topics tailored to annoy you. As a result of these changes, says Joe Mulhall, head of research at Hope Not Hate, “the platform has been flooded by individuals who were previously de-platformed, ranging from extreme niche accounts to figures like Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate”. We saw the real-life effects of this when misinformation over the identity, ethnicity and faith of the killer of three young girls in Southport incited explicitly racist unrest across the UK this August, such as hasn’t been seen since the 70s. X, Mulhall says, “was a central hub not only for creating the climate for the riots, but also the organisation and distribution of content that led to riots”. After the race riots in August it transpired that one man, “keyboard warrior” Wayne O’Rourke, convicted for inciting racial hatred on social media, was earning £1,400 a month from his activities on X. The blowhard Laurence Fox declared last month that he earns a similar amount from posting on X. O’Rourke had 90,000 followers; Tommy Robinson has more than a million, and it’s likely that he’s making far more. Governments, meanwhile, have no reliable redress, even when, as Mulhall puts it, “decisions made on the west coast of America are demonstrably affecting our communities”. In April, Brazil’s supreme court sought suspensions of fewer than 100 X accounts, for hate speech and fake news – mainly supporters of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, disputing the legitimacy of his defeat. X refused, and declined to represent itself in court. On Monday, the court unanimously upheld a ban on the entire platform, arguing that it “considered itself above the rule of law”. It’s extraordinary that Musk didn’t do more to avoid that, from a business perspective, but it may be that there are things he values more than money, such as immunity from governmental or democratic constraint. So is it moral to remain on a platform that does so much to bring the politics of division and hatred off the keyboard and into real life? Is X any worse than Facebook, or TikTok, or (for God’s sake!) YouTube? And is it worse on purpose, which is to say, are we watching the unfolding of a Musk masterplan? “It’s not the first time we’ve had extremist content online,” says Saperia. “There are lots of bad platforms, lots of bad things happen on them.” X’s problem may not be that its regulations are bad, but that its enforcement is bad, he points out, and it is not alone in that. “Have you looked at the UK court system lately? There are cases being heard from five years ago. If you don’t have laws, you don’t have a society.” X might be both spur and muster point for civil unrest, from the January 6 US Capitol attack to Southport and beyond, but we should also keep in mind, Saperia says, that “politics is moving to the right, not just because of the media environment, but for complex economic reasons: the middle-class west is getting poorer”. Donald Trump may have shocked the US legacy media by speaking directly to voters with coarse, increasingly unhinged messaging, but if we think a contented population, secure in a prosperous future, would have embraced his authoritarian lurch, we’re dreaming. Rage is out there, whether social media bankrolls it or not, and “all the mainstream platforms were generally failing on hate speech”, Mulhall says. “They didn’t want this content but they were struggling to deal with it. Then they would step up a bit after a Charlottesville [the white supremacist rally in 2017] or Capitol Hill.” Nevertheless, Hope Not Hate separates far-right online activism into three strains: mainstream platforms – X, Instagram, Facebook – which aren’t into fascism but struggle to snuff it out, and arguably don’t invest enough in moderation and regulation; co-opted platforms, such as Discord and Telegram, which start off as chat sites or messaging services, and maybe due to their superior privacy or encryption, become the favourite chat apps of the far right; and bespoke platforms, such as Rumble (part-funded by the fundamentalist libertarian and billionaire Peter Thiel), Gab (which became a nidus of primarily antisemitic hatred after the perpetrator of the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting posted his manifesto there) or Parler, which Kanye West almost bought in 2022, after he had been banned from Instagram and Twitter for antisemitism. “Twitter has broken the mould,” Mulhall says. “It’s ostensibly a mainstream platform which now has bespoke moderation policies. Elon Musk is himself inculcated with radical right politics. So it’s behaving much more like a bespoke platform, created by the far right. This marks it out significantly from any other platform. And it’s extremely toxic, an order of magnitude worse, not least because, while it still has terms of service, they’re not necessarily implementing them.” Musk’s commitment to free speech is jaw-droppingly unconvincing: he used it to reject Brazil’s demands, yet readily acceded to Narendra Modi’s demands in India, and suspended hundreds of accounts linked to farmers’ protests there in February this year. “Things like free speech are instruments to Musk, rather than principles,” Mulhall says. “He’s a tech utopian with no attachment to democracy.” Global civil society, though, finds it incredibly difficult to reject the free speech argument out of hand, because the alternative is so dark: that a number of billionaires – not just Musk but also Thiel with Rumble, Parler’s original backer, Rebekah Mercer (daughter of Robert Mercer, funder of Breitbart), and, indirectly, billionaire sovereign actors such as Putin – are successfully changing society, destroying the trust we have in each other and in institutions. It’s much more comfortable to think they’re doing that by accident, because they just love “free speech”, than that they’re doing that on purpose. “Part of understanding the neo-reactionary and ‘dark enlightenment’ movements, is that these individuals don’t have any interest in the continuation of the status quo,” Mulhall says. “In some jurisdictions,” Saperia says, “what sovereigns do and what billionaires do are quite related.” You can see that in Russia where, Mulhall says, “Putin is happy to use the state to manipulate social media to create polarisation – that’s been pretty much proven”. But where tech and politics aren’t aligned, politics doesn’t tend to come out on top. Governments look pretty powerless in the face of these massive tech companies. “Race hatred and attempted murder is incubated on these platforms,” Mulhall says, “and people don’t even think it’s possible to get Musk in front of parliament.” In Paris, the founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, is being formally investigated for his app’s alleged role in organised crime, and Musk has been named in a cyberbullying lawsuit brought by the gold medallist Imane Khelif. The boxer, who was born female and has never identified as either trans or intersex, was subjected to libellous claims about her gender by numerous public figures – British politicians, JK Rowling, Donald Trump – all on X. Andrew Tate, meanwhile, may have been charged by the Romanian authorities with human trafficking and rape, but his online misogynist fantasies of women as a slave caste, which have immense global reach, have attracted no censure greater than de-platforming, by YouTube, Insta, TikTok and Facebook – while the impact of these bans was lessened, even undone, by his freedom to operate on X. The EU has been more successful than the US in at least conceiving of social media giants as having the same corporate responsibility as, say, a pharmaceutical or oil company, but regulation still races to catch up with the changing reality, in which divisions are migrating faster than ever from the virtual to the real world. But we don’t need a government to step in and tell us to stop using X; we could do that on our own. Brazilians, Twitterless, have been migrating to Bluesky, which was set up in 2019 by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Bluesky’s Wang described on Monday “a wild ride even in the last four days. As of this morning, we’ve had nearer 2 million new users.” If we all did that (I’ve done that!), would it obliterate X’s power? Or would there just be a bifurcation, a Good Place and a Bad Place? Bluesky serves a similar purpose to X but is designed completely differently, as Wang describes: “No single entity has control over the platform, all the code is open-sourced, anyone can copy and paste our entire code. We can’t own your data, you can take it wherever you want. We have to win your usership through our performance or else you will leave. That’s much more like how search engines work. If you enshittify the search engine by placing ads everywhere, people will go to a different search engine.” The main hurdle has been that people migrate in packs and until recently weren’t migrating fast enough. If they do, and Saperia is right, Bluesky and Threads (which now has 175 million active monthly users), will ultimately supplant X. Will it be the same? It can’t be – the free-for-all of the open web, from which Twitter created its famous “town square” discursive experience (anyone could chat, and look, the Coastguard Agency and CNN were also right there) has been replaced by a social media idea Saperia calls the “dark forest” and Wang describes as “you find your people in small spaces, and work together to build an experience that you want – basic human building blocks of interaction”. Did Musk take a thing we all loved and smash it? Pretty much. But “a small group of people governing spaces for billions of people just doesn’t work”, Wang says. So, one way or another, someone was bound to. • This article was amended on 5 September 2024. An earlier version said Kanye West bought the social network Parler in 2022.

technology/2025/jul/14/musk-giant-tesla-factory-germany,Musk’s giant Tesla factory casts shadow on lives in a quiet corner of Germany,"When Elon Musk advised Germans to vote for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in elections last year, Manu Hoyer – who lives in the small town where the billionaire had built Tesla’s European production hub – wrote to the state premier to complain. “How can you do business with someone who supports rightwing extremism?” she asked Dietmar Woidke, the Social Democrat leader of the eastern state of Brandenburg, who had backed the setting up of the Tesla Giga factory in Grünheide. Hoyer said that in Woidke’s “disappointing, but predictable” answer, he denied the charge. “He said he didn’t know him personally. As if that excused him.” She had co-founded a Citizens’ Initiative to oppose Musk’s plans, announced in 2019, to build in the sparsely populated municipality in the sandy plains south-east of Berlin. The initiative’s fears at the time were largely over the potential environmental impact of the plant on the region’s pine forests and groundwater. However, more recently it is Musk’s politics that have caused particular alarm. Not only has he offered his high-profile support to far-right European parties, but at a rally after Donald Trump’s inauguration he appeared to twice make the Nazi salute. In the meantime Tesla sales have slumped, especially in Europe – where new vehicle sales fell for five consecutive months despite an overall growth in the electric car market. Heiko Baschin, another member of the citizen’s initiative, said he had been watching with a certain amount of schadenfreude. “We put our hopes in this,” the carpenter said, discussing the change in the company’s fortunes on a recent forest walk in the shadows of the sprawling Grünheide factory. As sales have declined, the factory has suffered. Shifts manufacturing the Y-Model have been reduced from three to two a day. The trade union IG Metall – which recruited several hundred workers despite opposition from Tesla – has urged the company to consider putting workers on “kurzzeit”, the short-time work allowance much of the embattled car industry has introduced to enable it to retain workers during a downturn. The regional press has reported how unsold Teslas have been moved on transporters en masse to a former East German airport 60km (37 miles) away, where, hidden behind trees and parked alongside solar panels, they bake in the sun. Musk’s apparent Nazi salute was in general met with shock and horror in Germany but did not play large in Grünheide, until campaign groups projected an image of it on to the facade of the Tesla factory, provocatively placing the Nazi-associated word “heil” in front of the Tesla logo. The shock caused by the incident was palpable on the factory floor, workers told the tabloid Berliner Kurier. “At Tesla Germany they had pretended they had nothing to do with (Musk) and were keeping quiet,” it wrote. Now they could no longer ignore their association. Workers are hard to reach, most having been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). But on Kununu, a job portal where employees can anonymously vent their feelings about their workplace, one Tesla worker has written: “The brand once stood for cosmopolitanism, progress, and tolerance, but now it stands for the exact opposite. That bothers almost everyone here, and you can feel it”. Almut, a resident of Grünheide, said local politicians were keen to cite the benefits Tesla had brought to the region, but “neglect to mention at the same time the problematic reality that we are subsidising the richest man in the world, who in no way takes any social responsibility for what happens here”. She said local people joke among themselves about what might take the place of the factory, should Tesla fail. “A munitions factory? A prison? In some ways these would seem like favourable alternatives,” she said. The only positive contribution as she saw it that Tesla had contributed to Grünheide was a robotic lawn mower it had donated to the local football club. *** Two weeks before the salute, Musk had followed his endorsement of the AfD in the German federal elections with an hour-long conversation with the anti-immigrant party’s co-leader, Alice Weidel. The two discussed topics including Hitler, solar power and German bureaucracy, which Musk said had required Tesla to submit forms running to 25,000 pages in order to build the Grünheide factory. Unmentioned was the fact that the AfD had vehemently opposed the Tesla factory, citing its fears over US-driven turbo capitalism and a watering down of workers’ rights. “People really need to get behind the AfD,” Musk said. For Grünheide’s residents who oppose Musk, their preoccupation remains the impact of the factory on their rural community, which is characterised by its woodlands, lakes and rivers. Existing cycle paths have been diverted, and new roads have required the felling of large swathes of pine forest, threatening the already perilous supplies of drinking water in a region declared a drought zone, the driest anywhere in Germany. The 300-hectare (740 acre) large factory complex itself is due to be expanded in the near future by a further 100 hectares, under plans signed off by Grünheide’s mayor despite a local referendum in which 62% expressed their opposition. Supporters point to the 11,000 jobs the factory has created, and the boost it has given to the local economy in a region of the former communist east and which was one of the lowest-performing in the country. Some young people enthuse that the trains to Berlin now run more regularly, the supermarkets are better stocked, and that their home town is now on the map as a beacon of “green capitalism” alongside Shanghai, Nevada and Austin, locations of the other Tesla factories. They hanker for an invitation to the “rave cave” techno dance space Musk has allegedly constructed within the factory complex. The recruitment page of the factory’s website – which emphasises that diversity is at the core of its business model – shows a lengthy list of positions needing to be filled, from shift managers to maintenance technicians. Nevertheless, the mood has cooled even among those who used to enthusiastically speak out in favour of Tesla, such as a group of local teenage schoolboys who habitually flew drones over the site when the factory was under construction and proudly posted the footage from them on YouTube – until Musk asked them to stop. “Nobody is willing to speak publicly about Tesla/Elon any more … even anonymously,” one told the Guardian via text message, without elaborating. There was no response to a request for an interview with the company or for access to the factory. Arne Christiani, the mayor of Grünheide and an unwavering Musk enthusiast, said he was confident Tesla would stay in Grünheide and would thrive. He was unmoved, he said, by what Musk said or did. “You have to distinguish between what happens in the US and here in Grünheide,” he said. Hoyer, who lives 9km from the factory, said she had not relinquished her dream of one day being able to see a starry sky from her garden again. “Since the factory was built the light pollution from the round-the-clock operation has put paid to that,” she said, showing before and after pictures on her mobile phone. • This article was amended on 14 July 2025.

technology/2025/may/23/elon-musk-new-city-starbase-texas,"Fear, hope and loathing in Elon Musk’s new city: ‘It’s the wild, wild west and the future’","Along a flat coastal highway in south-east Texas, surrounded by wetlands and open plains, the artefacts of a new American oligarchy appear in quick succession. Three towering rockets stand upright on the horizon. A fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks speeds by. A large mural of the Shiba Inu “doge” dog stares ahead, its arms crossed. There is a 4-metre-tall (12ft) bust of the world’s richest person, painted in bronze, facing a dusty roadside. “ELON aka MemeLord”, a plaque beneath reads. It’s not exactly romantic poetry, but the whole scene reminds me of the sonnet by Shelley: “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!” While old Ozymandias may have seen his fiefdoms crumble, Elon Musk’s empire is possibly only just beginning. Here in Cameron County, on the southern tip of the Lone Star state, where Google Maps proudly displays the newly declared “Gulf of America” just offshore, Musk has situated his self-described mission to save humanity and populate Mars. Just a few miles from his painted bust is the Starbase industrial complex, a rocket-manufacturing facility and launch arena, which commands the vista for miles. It is also the site of the multibillionaire’s latest venture to acquire even more political power. Fresh from an extended stay in Washington as the de facto leader of the government-slashing, conflict-of-interest-riddled, so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Musk has returned in time to see Starbase become its own city. We are here shortly before the vote, where there is little doubt that the 280 eligible voters (the vast majority of whom are employed by or connected to Musk’s space exploration company SpaceX) will approve the incorporation of a new, 4 sq km (1.6 sq mile) municipality. There remain many questions about why the company, which did not respond to any of my written questions and interview requests, would move for such recognition. It brings limited local powers, including the ability to impose minor property taxes and grant building permits, as well as the mandate to create its own fire department and – to some alarm – police department. And yet, as the US lurches further into what many describe as an era of norm-shattering digital dystopia under the second presidency of Donald Trump, the goings-on here, in this remote enclave by the US-Mexico border, already bring a sense of grisly prescience. As we pull off the highway into the Starbase neighbourhood (Boca Chica village, before the vote), we are trailed almost instantly by two white security trucks with flashing yellow lights. We drive along the main residential drag, where dozens of shiny, silver Airstream trailers – housing for SpaceX staff – sit in neat symmetry. We pass the newly renamed “Memes Street” (formerly it was Weems Street), marked with a black street sign accompanied by a small image of Musk’s pioneering Starship rocket. On the adjacent LBJ Boulevard, lined with modest homes and customised Cybertrucks parked outside, we pass what is reportedly Musk’s personal residence, a small bungalow winged by a high black fence. As I get out, I chat with the security guard who has trailed us for the past five minutes. He informs me with a smile that while the roads may be public, if I step on to the front lawns of any of the homes, he’ll seek to have me arrested. “It’s private property,” he says. Time to leave. While downtown Starbase may be a little averse to visitors, it’s a different story in the ranchlands outside. Musk founded the facility in late 2014, and its rapid expansion in recent years has drawn a small platoon of Mars obsessives to the area. A few miles away from the production site, at a staging location seen in the distance, a Starship rocket is preparing for a static engine test. Clouds of vapour cascade from the 170ft vehicle, and small groups of awestruck spectators congregate at intervals on the roadside. Many are livestreamers and photographers who document the minutiae of Starbase’s activities in extraordinary detail; surveying the serial numbers of components, the progress of launchpad construction and the particulars of planning documents, to assess when the next Starship launch is likely to take place. “When you’re standing here it’s a weird combination of the wild, wild west and the brand new future,” says a livestreamer named Caesar G, who works for an independent YouTube channel called NASASpaceflight, which has 1.32 million subscribers. He’s focusing a long lens camera on the testing taking place a few miles away, arms flailing with excitement. “Take the politics out of everything,” he says. “This is the coolest thing that’s going on, engineering-wise. We are catching rockets!” While there is no doubt that the midair mechanical capture of a 232ft rocket booster, as happened here first in October of last year, is an extraordinary technological achievement, I do wonder how it is possible to distinguish it from politics, given the company’s owner is also accused of making a fascist salute during Donald Trump’s second inauguration. Shaun Gisler, a self-described “aerospace histographer”, who is also livestreaming at the roadside, chimes in on this point. “He’s accused of a lot of things,” Gisler says. “A lot of that is just white noise. I’m looking at the result out here and I’m seeing success. We’re hoping this gets to a point where it becomes so big, it helps bridge the [political] gap.” The full engine test does not happen for another five hours, but both men are committed to waiting out in the humidity to film it. We drive a little farther inland to meet with Anthony Gomez, a manager of the Rocket Ranch campground, which caters to hundreds of travelling space tourists every year. Gomez moved here in 2021, abandoning his life in Florida to witness what he believes are the beginnings of a programme that will save humanity. We head to a viewing platform which commands an uninterrupted view of the launchpads and is fronted by a fire trench designed to protect visitors in the wake of a catastrophic rocket explosion. He wells up describing the feeling of watching a takeoff here. “Every cell and molecule is shaking with some form of elation,” he says. “It is overwhelming. It’s the apex of human technology. And when that thing takes off, somehow that is communicated. Somehow that information is delivered into your heart.” At the ranch, a cabin displays fragments of recovered Starship debris, and a large mural recreates Michelangelo’s ‘The Creation of Adam’, replacing God’s finger with one belonging to a Tesla humanoid robot named Optimus. We are meeting just days after a federal budget proposal by the Trump administration advances crippling cuts to low-income housing assistance while greenlighting a $1bn investment in Mars programmes, which is likely to benefit Musk. Gomez, who does not identify as a Trump supporter, is unfazed by the apparent cronyism, arguing that homelessness is “the average human’s responsibility”, not that of the government. Plus, he argues, space exploration may one day allow us to retrieve gold- and platinum-encrusted asteroids to cure global poverty. “There are asteroids floating around in space that can make the entire world wealthy,” he claims. He acknowledges that the technology to receive such a planetary boon is probably centuries away, but argues that the new private space race should “give people a focus of hope”. It can be hard to unpick the politics here; a mixture of right-leaning libertarianism that feels largely mainstream, and visions of a tech utopia that seem more grounded in science fiction than reality. “If you want to take people to Mars, it’s going to include everyone on Earth,” Gomez says when I ask about Musk’s clear nods to white nationalism. “Why would you have any specific hate towards anybody?” There are, of course, many expert scientific critics of Musk’s highly ambitious Mars plan, which has humans reaching the planet before the end of this decade. How would astronauts be protected from cosmic radiation during the journey and while exploring the red planet? How would Starship refuel for a return trip? Can SpaceX even get Starship to orbit Earth in the first place? (The last two launches have ended in explosive failure.) But perhaps the most pressing question is why humanity would want to spend trillions of dollars on such a project while pervasive crises on Earth persist. You don’t need to look far in Cameron County to see this rammed home. This is a low-income, majority Latino community of just over 400,000 people, where almost a quarter of residents live below the poverty line. In the county’s main population hub, Brownsville, disdain for the Starbase facility and its impending city status seems to be the predominant view. While Musk’s foundation has made charitable donations to the local school system and downtown revitalisation efforts, many people I speak to have seen little positive impact. Some complain that their homes shake during launches. Others say that the arrival of heavy industry has beaten up the county highways with little sign of repair. More object to ongoing gentrification. Josette Cruz, a local organiser and lifelong Brownsville resident, points to soaring housing costs associated with an influx of new residents tied to SpaceX expansion and increased tourism. Her rent, she says, has risen from $725 a month to an almost unaffordable $1,000 in just a few years. Realtor signs now spring up in her neighbourhood with images of cartoon rockets. “The fact that people can come here and say, ‘We’re going to have our own election, we’re going to build our own town’, what kind of mentality says that, if not one that is rooted in a colonial, settler mindset?” she says, shrugging. “They want to go to Mars to colonise it.” We take a trip back out past the Starbase facility to Boca Chica beach, a public state park just a few hundred feet from the Starship launch pads. The juxtaposition here is stark. Warnings not to disturb the nesting grounds of the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle are stationed across the beach entrance, framed by the giant launch pads and frantic construction work just metres away. In September last year SpaceX was fined almost $150,000 by the Environmental Protection Agency for spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of polluted wastewater on to the surrounding wetlands after rocket launches. It is a charge the company has continued to deny. We meet local environmentalist Bekah Hinojosa, who in 2022 was arrested by local police over alleged involvement in the graffiti found on a Musk-sponsored mural in Brownsville. The three words, written in blue, read: “gentrified stop spaceX”. Hinojosa was apprehended in her pyjamas after plain-clothed officers arrived at her doorstep. Three years later, having pleaded not guilty to a class three misdemeanor, she is still awaiting a trial date. Like many generational residents, Hinojosa’s family have visited this beach for decades, coming to fish at the shoreline and enjoy the tranquillity. But every launch now means a beach closure, and many fear the incorporation of Starbase city will lead to further restrictions on access. “Using a low-income community for experimental rocket testing is another example of environmental racism,” she says, as a group of sandpiper birds paddle in the surf nearby. “Billionaires should not own a beach. We will continue speaking up because, for us, it’s about continuing to exist here.” Just coming down to the water’s edge can now feel like an act of resistance, it seems. The morning of the Starbase vote brings with it dark skies and torrential rain. We make a final trip to the complex and stand in the drizzle outside the polling station. It’s a cafeteria open only to SpaceX employees, but a small huddle of journalists seems to keep the security guards away this time. Most voters say they have been told by their employer not to talk to the press. But a stroke of luck allows us to meet one of the handful of residents who cast a ballot in opposition. She is one of the few hold-out residents, still living in a privately owned home on Memes Street. I can only imagine what it must be like to have your permanent address changed to a sophomoric joke. “I was here before SpaceX and I have no loyalty issues,” she says after casting her ballot and declining to be named. I ask how she feels about populating Mars. She grimaces and walks away. The vote ends up passing by a majority of 212 to six. A 97% margin. The city’s new mayor, Robert Peden, is a SpaceX vice-president. He ran unopposed. Three days later the Federal Aviation Authority, an agency previously purged by Doge, approves an aggressive new SpaceX flight programme that will allow the company to quintuple its annual launches from five to 25. The next Starship is scheduled to take off later this week.

technology/2025/jan/12/fears-for-uk-boomer-radicalisation-on-facebook-after-meta-drops-factcheckers,Fears for UK boomer radicalisation on Facebook after Meta drops factcheckers,"Experts fear the decision by Meta to drop professional factcheckers from Facebook will exacerbate so-called boomer radicalisation in the UK. Even before what Keir Starmer described as “far-right riots” in England last summer, alarm bells were ringing amid fears older people were even more susceptible to misinformation and radicalisation than younger “digital natives”. Suspects were generally older than those charged in the 2011 unrest, according to a Guardian analysis of hundreds of defendants that found that as many as 35% were in their 40s or older. However, after Mark Zuckerberg announced last week that Meta would replace factcheckers with a crowdsourced system and recommend more political content, there is now new concern about the potential radicalisation risks on Facebook, the social media platform of choice for many older people. “It’s clearly a retrograde step that comes with all sorts of risks,” said Dr Sara Wilford of De Montfort University, a lead researcher on a pioneering Europe-wide project called Smidge (Social Media Narratives: Addressing Extremism in Middle Age). “X might be the model for the crowdsourced ‘community notes’ approach that Meta seems to be embracing, instead of professional moderators, but it just won’t work in the same way with Facebook, which very much operates in little silos or closed groups. I’m concerned that, for middle-aged Facebook users who risk being exposed to extremist content, it will be even harder to discern the truth.” The anti-extremism campaign group Hope not Hate also told the Guardian it feared Zuckerberg’s announcement was a prelude to far-right figures and groups, such as Tommy Robinson and Britain First, being allowed back on to Facebook. Britain First proved particularly adept at using the platform before it was banned, amassing 2m likes – at that stage surpassing Labour (1m) and the Conservatives (650,000). In terms of perpetrators of crime, young men still account for the majority of culprits. Yet before the riots, discussion about boomer radicalisation had already been sparked by cases such as Darren Osborne, who was 48 when he was jailed in 2018 for his lethal terror attack at a mosque in north London’s Finsbury Park, having been, in the words of the judge, “rapidly radicalised” online. Another man, Andrew Leak, was 66 when he firebombed a Dover migrant centre in 2022 in what police described as an “extreme rightwing” attack, later killing himself but leaving behind an internet history riddled with racism. When it came to the riots, Hope not Hate said Facebook was used in a particular way by the far right, in contrast to other platforms. “Telegram was for whipping up the most extreme hate, or sometimes plotting and planning, while X was used to to disseminate that message,” said Joe Mulhall, the anti-racism campaign group’s director of research. “Facebook was then often where you would see a group creating hyperlocal targeted content, with a page popping up around a specific event. We’ve also seen over the last three to four years that anti-migrant protest Facebook groups were really fundamental in organising the targeting of asylum centres.” Users of such pages often skew older, in line with broader Facebook usage. An Ofcom report last year found that overall, social media users were most likely to describe Facebook as their main social media site (48%), but added: “This was driven by its significant popularity among older social media users.” It also warned that older adults were less likely to recognise a fake social media profile. Wilford said her research suggested some older Facebook users were often particularly vulnerable, for reasons including a reluctance to factcheck and a tendency to trust online content at face value when it came packaged like conventional news output. “We are also talking about people – an invisible generation – sometimes looking back on a life that might not have been as they wanted it to be, whether it was their job or social conditions,” she added. “But when they go online and interact with other Facebook users, they are embracing an echo chamber that makes them feel good. They’re listened to and find validation.” The problem of misinformation seeping through to Facebook groups devoted to everyday life has drawn a response from some councils, which have devoted resources to training members of the public who moderate on local community groups. But Britain’s seismic political events of recent years have also transformed the Facebook experience for many whose first innocent interactions may have been sharing pictures with family or posting neighbourhood news. Brexit, Trump’s 2016 win and the Covid pandemic acted as catalysts for engagement with more extreme forms of rightwing politics via Facebook, according to Dr Natalie-Anne Hall, a lecturer at Cardiff University and author of Brexit, Facebook, and Transnational Right-Wing Populism. “Facebook is a key site for algorithmically driven encounters with these harmful ideas within people’s everyday practices of social media use. Meta should be doing more, not less, to combat this harm,” she said. “Zuckerberg’s comments and Meta’s new position on this issue will only serve to embolden the misplaced sense of victimhood among those with antiprogressive views that research has shown feeds into radicalisation.” When asked to comment on the concerns about misinformation and extremism, Meta referred to a blogpost, which said its “complex systems” to manage content had “gone too far”.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/12/fears-for-uk-boomer-radicalisation-on-facebook-after-meta-drops-factcheckers,Technology,2025-01-12T18:01:54Z,3
technology/article/2024/jul/27/tiktoks-algorithm-is-highly-sensitive-and-could-send-you-down-a-hate-filled-rabbit-hole-before-you-know-it,TikTok’s algorithm is highly sensitive – and could send you down a hate-filled rabbit hole before you know it,"TikTok’s algorithm works in mysterious ways, but a Guardian Australia experiment on a blank account shows how quickly a breaking news event can funnel users down a conservative Christian, anti-immigration rabbit hole. Last week we reported how Facebook and Instagram’s algorithms are luring young men into the Manosphere. This week, we explore what happens when TikTok’s algorithm is unleashed on a blank account in the absence of any interactions such as liking or commenting. In April, Guardian Australia set up a new TikTok account on a completely blank smartphone linked to a new, unused email address. A John Doe profile was set up as a generic 24-year-old male. We scrolled through the feed every couple of weeks. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Initially it was difficult to identify a clear theme to the video being served through the app. Then the Wakeley church stabbing attack happened on 15 April. For the first two days of the experiment, TikTok served up generic content about Melbourne, where the phone was located, along with videos about iPhone hacks – typical content one can expect on TikTok as an iPhone owner. On day three, TikTok news content began appearing, coinciding with the stabbing attack on bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church in the Sydney suburb of Wakeley. It wasn’t the video of the stabbing itself, but rather videos of Emmanuel’s evocative and conservative Christian sermons. Watching them appears to have triggered TikTok’s algorithm – more and more of his sermons were served up and conservative Christian videos began appearing one after the other. Three months later, the algorithm is still serving up conservative Christian content, alongside videos that are pro-Pauline Hanson, pro-Donald Trump, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ – including one video suggesting drag queens be fed into a woodchipper. As with the experiment run in parallel on Instagram and Facebook accounts, no posts were liked or commented on. But unlike that experiment, TikTok’s algorithm appears to be much more sensitive to even the slightest interaction – including the time spent watching videos. It will push similar content to users unless you indicate you’re not interested. “The more someone searches or engages with any type of content on TikTok, the more they will see,” a TikTok spokesperson said. “But at any time, you can totally refresh your feed, or let us know that you’re not interested in a particular video, by long pressing on the screen and selecting, ‘not interested’.” Jing Zeng, assistant prof of computational communication science at the University of Zurich, says there is a lot of randomness in TikTok’s “for you” algorithm, and early interactions can have strong implications for what you see. “If their first pro-Trump video ‘made you look’, then the ‘for you’ algorithm may test more of such content.” Jordan McSwiney, senior research fellow at the University of Canberra’s Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance, says TikTok’s approach differs from that of Facebook and Instagram because it has a more active recommendation system, designed to keep users engaging with videos one after the other. He says Meta is introducing this into its Reels product, which has a lot of the same features as TikTok. “We know that these platforms, they’re not operating with any kind of social licence. They’re not like a public broadcast or anything. They are beholden to one thing and one thing only, and that’s their bottom line,” he says. “Their modus operandi is not to facilitate nuanced debate, to promote a healthy democratic public sphere. It is to create content that people will keep clicking, to keep eyeballs on the app, to keep people scrolling, because that’s advertising revenue.” McSwiney says governments have a role in forcing tech platforms to be more transparent in how the algorithms operate, as they currently exist in a “black box”, with limited ability for researchers to see how they operate. He says the platforms can’t shrug off concerns over what is being served up as merely a reflection of the society in which they operate. “I just I don’t think we should let multibillion dollar companies off the hook like that. They have a social responsibility to ensure that their platforms are not causing harm – their platforms shouldn’t be promoting sexist content, [and] shouldn’t be promoting racist content.”",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/27/tiktoks-algorithm-is-highly-sensitive-and-could-send-you-down-a-hate-filled-rabbit-hole-before-you-know-it,Technology,2024-07-26T15:00:59Z,3
technology/2025/oct/27/ai-tech-donald-trump-san-francisco,Tech chiefs tell Trump to call off troops – will Firefox go ‘full AI’?,"Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, confounded by the ending of Bugonia and looking forward to seeing Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein. In this week’s newsletter: the head of Firefox talks AI-integrated browsers; the tech billionaires’ support of Trump and their successful request to defer national guard deployment to San Francisco; and the growing prevalence of face-scanning in online dating. Thank you for reading. The head of Firefox on AI in browsers Do you need an assistant for your online activities? Multiple major players in artificial intelligence are moving on from chatbots like ChatGPT and are now focusing their efforts on new browsers with deep AI integrations. Those could take the form of an agent that shops for you or an omnipresent chatbot that follows you around and summarizes what you’re seeing, looks up related stuff, or answers related questions. Last week alone, OpenAI released the ChatGPT Atlas browser, and Microsoft showed off Edge’s new Copilot Mode, both of which heavily feature chatbots. At the start of October, Perplexity made its Comet browser free. In mid-September, Google rolled out Chrome With Gemini, integrating its AI assistant with the most popular browser in the world. In the wake of these releases, I phoned the general manager of Firefox, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, for his thoughts on whether AI-first browsers will catch on, if his own browser will go full AI, and whether users maintain any expectation of privacy in this new era of personalized, agentic browsing. Read my Q&amp;A with the head of Firefox. AI’s presence grows in art and our everyday lives ‘I’m suddenly so angry!’ My strange, unnerving week with an AI ‘friend’ US student handcuffed after AI system apparently mistook bag of chips for gun AI can help authors beat writer’s block, says Bloomsbury chief Labor rules out giving tech giants free rein to mine copyright content to train AI SF’s tech billionaires tell Trump to call off the national guard on their home turf Last week, Donald Trump said he would not deploy the US national guard to San Francisco after proclaiming he would for weeks. What exempts SF from federal occupation but not Washington DC, Chicago or Los Angeles? The presence of tech billionaire donors, going by Trump’s Truth Social Post. “Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday,” Trump wrote on Thursday, referring to the threatened “surge” of national guard troops. Read more: Trump says tech chiefs convinced him to call off troop ‘surge’ to San Francisco The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, who has protested against the deployment of the national guard to Chicago for weeks, is also a billionaire. He is also an avowed Democrat and no friend of Trump. One can surmise why his phone calls to the White House didn’t have the same result as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang’s did. Huang has traveled with the president to the United Arab Emirates to announce a gargantuan AI deal, agreed to pay the US government 15% of his company’s revenue from chip sales in China, and donated to Trump’s inauguration. Marc Benioff has been at the center of the controversy from the start. The co-founder and CEO of Salesforce said in a controversial interview with the New York Times that Trump should make good on his threat and send in the troops. That was at the start of Salesforce’s major yearly conference, Dreamforce, which takes over downtown San Francisco like a homecoming reunion takes over a college town in the US. A few days of backlash later, Benioff walked back the remarks and rationalized them by saying he was only worried about conference security. Then he intervened with Trump to prevent the national guard’s deployment. The image that emerges is a billionaire who wants to have his cake (be close to Trump) and eat it too (seem a savior to San Francisco). The tech billionaires are getting what they paid for when donating to Trump, a direct line and an exemption for their home turf from his capricious use of force. Around the same time Huang and Benioff were gabbing with Trump on the phone, the East Wing of the White House met the business end of a backhoe. Backing that demolition is a coalition of tech companies and billionaires gifting hundreds millions of dollars to Trump for his grand ballroom project. What special treatment will they request after paying for a direct line to the president?

Put succinctly, it was a bug in a piece of automation software. My colleague Josh Taylor reports on the cloud computing blackout that took everything from Signal to smart beds offline: In a lengthy outline of the cause of the outage, Amazon revealed a cascading set of events that brought down thousands of sites and applications that host their services with the company. AWS said customers were unable to connect to DynamoDB, an AWS database service that maintains hundreds of thousands of domain name system (DNS) records. It uses automation to monitor the system to ensure that records are updated frequently. The root cause of the issue, Amazon said, was an empty DNS record for the Virginia-based US-East-1 datacentre region. The bug failed to automatically repair and required manual operator intervention to correct. Read more: Could the internet go offline?

Match Group, the app’s parent company, had already mandated facial verification when signing up in California. The US requirement made headlines in the largely US-based tech press, but Match Group also rolled out its voluntary face check feature in Australia, Canada and India. In each of those markets, Tinder ranks among the most popular dating apps. Match, which also owns Hinge and a slew of dating websites, plans to roll out the face-scanning feature to its other dating apps soon, paving the way for facial verification to become a near-universal requisite for online dating. Any pretense of anonymity on Tinder is gone. The change poses substantial questions of privacy but also promises significant safety benefits. If Tinder is hacked, facial scans can’t be changed like passwords. Biometric personal data is immutable. Or will law enforcement enjoin Match to hand over users’ faces en masse? On the other side of the coin, serial rapists have been able to use Tinder as a hunting ground, seemingly unhindered by the app’s safety features. Victims’ families have blamed Match for failing to verify users. A face scan might have been a shocking requirement for a signup in 2012, when Tinder debuted. Apple’s Face ID didn’t launch until 2017, although Samsung phones featured facial recognition features as far back as 2011. Users’ expectations of privacy and their willingness to trade it for new, more personalized features evolve over time, as Firefox’s Enzor-DeMeo said.

technology/2025/oct/17/dan-phil-relationship-youtubers-toxic-fan-reactions,Dan and Phil’s relationship revelation is a reminder of how toxic fandoms can be,"This week, longtime British YouTubers Dan Howell and Phil Lester uploaded a new video confirming they have been in a secret romantic relationship for the past 16 years. If you weren’t a deeply online child during the 2010s, you probably have no idea who Dan and Phil are, or why this matters. But to those who formed a robust parasocial bond with the duo – who have more than 13 million collective subscribers on YouTube – this was a revelatory moment. It was also a sobering reminder of the emotional damage that toxic fandoms can wreak on their subjects. Over the course of 45 minutes, Howell and Lester, now in their thirties, share the “apocalyptic constant stress of the Dan and Phil dating conspiracy”, where “fans” subjected them to frenzied speculation for 16 years straight. Whole subsets of the Dan and Phil fandom were dedicated to “proving”, once and for all, that the pair – known as “Phan”, à la Brangelina – were more than just friends. Online sleuths went on to dox, harass, and borderline stalk Howell and Lester; in the video, they describe even being filmed at the supermarket. As Lester describes, being a fan of Dan and Phil was as much about their funny videos as it was about “the secret mirror world of content” fans became obsessed with: the supposed hints and clues they dropped that would out a relationship they didn’t want to make public. Howell describes the impact of his “extremely homophobic childhood”, which kept him “deep in the closet” for many years (Howell and Lester individually came out as gay in 2019). “In my mid-20s, I felt we had to hide the relationship because I was still hiding who I was to my friends, family, myself,” Howell says. “This is why all of the digging from people online hit a nerve, because Phil was my safe space. […] what we had was the most important thing to me and I wanted to protect it, so when other people tried to grab it and drag it into the light, I felt completely violated.” The duo relate the unique humiliation of having a private Valentine’s Day video, made by Lester for Howell in the early, heady days of their relationship, get leaked due to a YouTube glitch. Only a handful of fans saw it, but the damage was done. The video was reuploaded, shared, commented on, used as evidence in the quest to uncover the conspiracy. It nearly broke Howell and Lester’s relationship for good. “I remember messaging someone saying, ‘Please, can you take this down?’” Lester says. “And they said, ‘No, what’s on the internet is for ever. It’s your fault.’ And I was like, ‘How can someone be so mean about something so personal?’” Howell, clearly still shaken by the experience more than a decade later, adds: “It felt like an assault.” Howell and Lester remain remarkably good-humoured in the video, and praise their fan community on the whole: “I want to be clear,” Howell says emphatically. “We love our audience. Dan and Phil followers are the funniest fandom. So creative. They’re good people.” But the more distressing revelations are startling, and an apt summation of the toxic way some modern fandoms function. The term “stan” originates from Eminem’s titular 2000 song about a fan so disturbed by his obsession with the artist that he ends up committing murder suicide – and these days, in online spaces, it feels as though the ‘stan’ and the ‘hater’ are becoming one and the same. Just days ago, Billie Eilish was physically dragged into the crowd by someone in the front row of her concert. In late 2019, K-pop idol Goo Hara took her own life after being subject to severe online harassment. And just in August, Amazon shared a PSA to fans of its hit show The Summer I Turned Pretty, instructing them that there was a “zero tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech”. “Keep the conversation kind,” Amazon posted later. “The show isn’t real but the people playing the characters are.” The caption accompanied a video graphic that read: “The summer we started acting normal online.” In 2025, almost every public figure has a ‘snark’ subreddit devoted to them, whose participants track their every move obsessively; imagine keeping a running tally of how many times someone yawns. Haters, just like fans, are the first to click on a new video, a new song, a new Instagram upload. The parasocialism of the stan and the hater is one and the same. And when it comes to scrutiny over someone’s sexuality, we know how invasive it can be for the subjects – because they’ve told us. In the Dan &amp; Phil video, Howell describes experiencing suicidal thoughts directly related to the intense speculation over his relationship from so-called fans. Last year pop star Shawn Mendes spoke publicly against the widespread rumours about his sexuality, saying it “always felt like such an intrusion on something very personal to me”. This week, Stranger Things star Noah Schnapp recalled journalists asking if he was gay when he was just 12 and 13. “I was obviously very scared of talking about it,” he said in an interview with Time. “I didn’t know what to say.” A subsection of Taylor Swift fans known as Gaylors pick over her songs and interviews for evidence she is secretly a lesbian. As Howell and Lester acknowledge, it’s normal to wonder about the private lives of celebrities – but the relentless scrutiny they have endured goes far beyond innocent curiosity. Regardless of whether it was coming from stans or haters, the “apocalyptic, constant stress” of it would feel exactly the same.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/17/dan-phil-relationship-youtubers-toxic-fan-reactions,Technology,2025-10-17T02:26:54Z,2
technology/2025/oct/02/elon-musk-netflix-trans-character-dead-end-paranormal-park,‘Cancel Netflix’: Elon Musk leads rightwing backlash over trans character in kids’ show,"Elon Musk, the multibillionaire and self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”, has in recent days trained his attention on getting people to cancel their Netflix subscriptions in protest of what he claims is the company’s “woke bias” and inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters. Musk, the richest person in the world with a net worth of approximately $500bn, has repeatedly encouraged his 227 million followers on X, the platform he controls, to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. In the past three days alone, he has posted or reposted calls to cancel Netflix for its content at least 26 times. Musk’s anti-Netflix tirade began on Tuesday, when he posted “this is not ok” while reposting from rightwing activist account Libs of TikTok’s clip of the Netflix show Dead End: Paranormal Park, in which the character Barney says he is transgender. “Dead End Paranormal Park, a show on Netflix, is pushing pro-transgender on CHILDREN. This show is advertised for 7-YEAR-OLDS,” said the Libs of TikTok post, referring to Netflix’s TV-Y7 rating designating the show appropriate for viewers aged seven and older. Paranormal Park ran for 20 episodes in 2022, and was canceled by Netflix the following year. The company is not currently promoting the show. Zach Barack, the voice actor for Barney and the first openly trans actor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, quickly rebuffed Musk’s narrative on X, writing: “you can fear monger all you want, but kids &amp; parents have told me it saved their lives!!” In the days since, Musk has reposted several tweets from other users who claim to have canceled their subscriptions in protest of what he claims is an agenda to brainwash children with content supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” he posted on Wednesday while quoting a meme depicting Netflix’s “transgender woke agenda” as a Trojan horse being admitted to a castle labeled “your kids”. “True,” he wrote on Thursday over another user’s tweet claiming: “Transgender propaganda isn’t just quietly lurking in the background on Netflix. They are actively pushing it on users.” He linked to an article on Netflix’s Tudum media site titled “Celebrate Trans Day of Visibility with These 16 Movies and Shows”. Musk has also called out pro-trans themes in shows such as The Baby-Sitters Club and Cocomelon, advanced rightwing arguments that Netflix has an “anti-white” hiring process, and reposted false claims, including that 100% of political donations by Netflix employees in 2024 went to Democrats. Additionally, Musk commented “Cancel Netflix” on a Libs of TikTok post about Netflix’s 2023 report on its diversity and inclusion initiatives. Musk is the father of a trans daughter, Vivian Wilson, who has publicly criticized her father’s anti-trans vendetta. In her 2022 petition to legally change her name and gender, Wilson wrote: “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” Musk has since said that he “lost my son, essentially” and claimed that he had been “tricked” into allowing gender-affirming care for Wilson, whom he claimed was “dead, killed by the woke mind virus”. Netflix, a company whose executives have repeatedly invoked freedom of speech when faced with backlash for content on its platform, has not publicly responded to Musk’s taunts. This is not the first time the company has come under fire from the right; in 2020, outrage over its film Cuties, which depicted underage actors performing sexualized dance routines, led to a spike in US customer cancellations, though it receded within days. In 2021, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos cited free speech when defending comedian Dave Chappelle, whose anti-trans comments in his special The Closer led to an employee walkout at Netflix’s California headquarters. Sarandos has also stood behind the company’s decision to commission three specials from rightwing comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, whose racist comments calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a Trump rally last year drew widespread consternation. Musk’s calls for mass cancellation of Netflix subscriptions comes on the heels of an unrelated free speech firestorm in Hollywood over Disney’s indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow under pressure from the Trump administration. After backlash from celebrities as well as customers cancelling their Disney+ subscriptions, the company allowed Kimmel back on the air.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/02/elon-musk-netflix-trans-character-dead-end-paranormal-park,Technology,2025-10-02T20:20:04Z,2
technology/2025/sep/29/youtube-trump-lawsuit-settlement,YouTube agrees to pay Trump $24.5m to settle lawsuit over account suspension,"YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5m to settle a suit brought by Donald Trump in 2021 that alleged the platform wrongly suspended his channel after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The Google subsidiary is the latest in a long string of tech companies to make a multimillion-dollar payout to the president over past decisions about his accounts. Trump had filed the suit against YouTube and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, alleging that the platform had “accumulated an unprecedented concentration of power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse”. YouTube said it suspended Trump’s channel because it had violated the website’s policies against inciting violence. Because of the settlement, the case is now dismissed. Google did not immediately return a request for comment. The news comes just a week after YouTube announced that it would allow creators who were once banned for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 US presidential election to be reinstated. In its announcement, YouTube said it celebrated conservative voices on its site and blamed the account suspensions on pressure from Joe Biden. Facebook-parent company Meta settled a similar lawsuit with Trump in January for $25m, and the social media platform X, previously Twitter, settled another for $10m in February. Most of the payout from the Meta suit will go to Trump’s presidential library fund. For the YouTube settlement, Trump has directed $22m of the payment to go to restoring and preserving the National Mall and supporting construction of the White House ballroom, according to documents filed in the US district court for the northern district of California. The lavish ballroom is expected to cost around $200m. The three cases were first brought by Trump lawyer and ally, John Coale, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news. Coale told the Journal that Trump’s return to the White House was instrumental in reaching the slew of settlements with tech companies, saying: “If he had not been re-elected, we would have been in court for 1,000 years.” Coale is now Trump’s deputy special envoy to Ukraine and Belarus. In an email to the Guardian, Coale said Trump was an “ideal client”. “Glad it and the others I filled [sic] for DJT in July or [sic] 2021 ended to the tune of 60mil,” Coale added. “We got $$$ and changed tech behavior I believe.” The case against YouTube had been closed in 2023, but Trump’s lawyers filed to reopen the case after he won the presidency. Before his victory, all three of the lawsuits faced uphill court battles. A federal judge dismissed the case against Twitter in 2022, and the suits against Meta and YouTube were stayed, then the latter was administratively close. Trump’s lawyers, however, revived the cases with appeals to overturn each ruling. YouTube first suspended Trump’s channel for seven days on 12 January 2021, after he posted a video saying the speech he made to his supporters on January 6 before the Capitol riot was “totally appropriate”. YouTube said it suspended the channel over “concerns about the ongoing potential for violence”. The company then extended the ban without an end date. It wasn’t until March 2023, after Trump announced his bid for his second presidency, that YouTube reinstated Trump’s channel, saying it “carefully evaluated the continued risk of real-world violence, balancing that with the importance of preserving the opportunity for voters to hear equally from major national candidates in the run up to an election”. Within hours of getting his channel back, Trump posted: “I’M BACK!” accompanied by an 11-second video of him talking at a rally saying: “Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business. Complicated.”",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/29/youtube-trump-lawsuit-settlement,Technology,2025-09-30T00:03:21Z,2
technology/2025/sep/17/charlie-kirk-suspect-online-memes,Memes and nihilistic in-jokes: the online world of Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer,"On the day that 22-year-old Tyler Robinson shot and the killed rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, prosecutors say, he texted his roommate to confess what he had done. While appearing to admit to the murder and describe how he was planning to retrieve his gun, he pivoted to mention why he had carved messages into the ammunition. “Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme,” Robinson texted, according to authorities. Robinson’s shooting of Kirk has put the spotlight on the intersection of political violence and an increasingly nihilistic online world that promotes misinformation and extremism. It’s a confluence that raises fundamental questions about how internet culture influences both extremist attacks and how we understand them, at a time when some of the biggest online spaces are increasingly more divisive and less moderated. Robinson appeared to spend much of his life on the internet and playing video games, with friends describing him as “terminally online”. He was active on Discord, a messaging platform popular among the gaming community, and as a teenager dressed up as internet memes for Halloween. Bullet casings from the gun he allegedly fired were engraved with niche references and internet-speak – “notices bulge OwO what’s this”, a reference to a meme about sex within the online Furry subculture, “if you read this you are gay LMAO”, “Hey Fascist! CATCH!”, as well as the controller movements to use a special bomb in the popular video game Helldivers 2 and the lyrics to the antifascist song Bella Ciao, which has become popular among gamers after featuring in the game Far Cry 6. In Robinson’s exchanges with his roommate, who he was also romantically involved with, he appeared to have been thinking of how the ironic messages would be received. “If I see ‘uwu notices bulge’ on fox new [sic] I might have a stroke,” Robinson texted. With the references, Robinson fits a modern trend of attackers leaving behind messages that not only show they are products of an online culture, but are in conversation with it. In recent years, a growing number of shooters have left behind writings, whether full manifestos or single-sentence posts online, that contain nihilistic in-jokes and references that aim to differentiate their extremely online cohort from the “normies” who will struggle to understand them. The manifesto left behind by the neo-Nazi who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 contained both extreme white nationalist ideology and “shitpost”-style ironic references to video games and podcasters. The man who opened fire at a supermarket in El Paso, Texas, that same year announced his killings on the message board 8chan, prompting users to create memes and encourage others to try to “beat their high scores” in body count. Extremist mass killings at a supermarket in a predominantly Black area of Buffalo, New York, in 2022 and at a synagogue in Poway, California, in 2019 were both heavily versed in the language of fringe online forums. A multi-newsroom investigation in 2022 that pored over tens of thousands of messages from an international neo-Nazi extremist network found that the chats were inflected with memes and gaming slang as they planned to commit violence. In addition to speaking to their online communities, attackers are also often in dialogue with each other, whether in some far-right circles where extremists celebrate individuals as “saints” with their own memorialized days or simply through copying elements of previous killings. As others have noted, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter who attacked a Minneapolis Catholic school. It also echoes the engravings that the alleged United Healthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione is reported to have left on his bullets, which became a meme to the point it featured on shirts from a popular alt-fashion label. Robinson’s engravings themselves don’t offer a cohesive explanation for Kirk’s killing. Prosecutors say Robinson told his roommate he shot Kirk because the conservative activist was spreading hatred. They also allege that his mother told investigators that her son had spent the previous year or so becoming “more political and had started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans rights oriented”. But much about Robinson’s path to radicalization is still unclear. There is an enormous gulf between holding opposition to Kirk’s views and carrying out a targeted killing. And increasingly, experts say, the motivation of shooters, particularly young ones, don’t fit neatly into a traditional left-right spectrum but are shaped by the fractured, heavily online state of modern politics. Ignoring the messier nature of radicalization in lieu of fitting attackers into convenient boxes risks missing what actually drives people to commit acts of extremist violence. The radicalization of being online Instead of trying to find precise meaning in the irony soaked, trolling messages that attackers have left behind, extremism researchers argue that it’s often more useful to look at how online mediums are broadly shaping radicalization. In fact, some say that the current era of political violence differs from past incarnations specifically because of the way that social media and online communities have influenced and incentivized attackers. Although technological influences are only one part of rising political violence – along with mental health issues, political polarization and the widespread availability of firearms in the US – extremism researchers are increasingly studying the evolving ways that social media platforms and online spaces can radicalize and isolate users. In a 2023 paper for George Washington University’s Project on Extremism, Jacob Ware, a researcher described what he called a “third generation of online radicalization” that emerged in the late 2010s. Some of its characteristics include how meme culture helps radicalize and normalize attacks, as well as how precise ideology or affiliation with an organization becomes less important than lone acts of violence. The online culture around violence and extremism ends up blurring traditional lines of terrorism, Ware argues, as well as encourages making performative content to go along with attacks. “Global grievances are acted upon with great fury in very local contexts – and yet, the main audience is often online,” Ware writes. The growth of social media and erosion of previous gatekeepers have also left it unclear how to counter the spread of online radicalization, especially given social media platforms’ shift towards shirking responsibility for hosting violent and extreme content. What was once the generally accepted policy among media outlets and platforms to not share attackers’ manifestos, part of a public health argument from researchers to avoid copycats, has degraded as social media has given way to amateur sleuths posting every element of someone’s digital footprint for clues. And as messages and memes from attackers spread more easily, they also in turn generate more posts riffing on the violence and turning it into content. It is a particularly dark function of an industry that has built its growth through algorithmically pushing politically divisive and extremist content. The result is that while online culture has enmeshed itself into extremism and political violence, previously secluded parts of the extremist internet culture have increasingly infected the everyday internet. The use of ironic humour connected to violence and extremism is not unique to the digital age – an essay from 1944 once discussed how antisemites amused themselves with flippant hateful statements – but it has become an incredibly pervasive part of the online experience. Ideologies and memes that would have once been relegated to obscure comment boards and extremist websites are now essentially the native tongue of the internet and distributed through mainstream social media platforms. Kirk himself was a product of this online world, best known for viral clips of his combative, debate-style exchanges that social media users across the political spectrum shared to either champion or mock him. Videos of Kirk’s killing have since fed into the same online spaces and content machine where he was once ubiquitous, sometimes autoplaying on X without warning viewers. Reactions to his death have become part of the same content mill, with video essays claiming to explain the killing and AI-generated tributes depicting him in heaven proliferating online. An aspiring influencer who was attending the event where Kirk was shot even attempted to immediately farm the killing for content, posting a video of himself promoting his social media channels during the chaos. “Make sure you subscribe!” the TikToker, who later deleted the video, said while flashing a peace sign as attenders around him screamed and fled.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/charlie-kirk-suspect-online-memes,Technology,2025-09-17T11:00:33Z,2
technology/2025/jul/28/techscape-ai-google-meta-amazon,The trillion-dollar AI arms race is here,"Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Johana Bhuiyan and Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who’s enjoying the beach but likely getting sunburned. Tech companies throw billions towards AI infrastructure Tech companies are fighting to claim the title of having the world’s most advanced AI. The goal is to supercharge their bottom line and keep investors and Wall Street happy. But developing the world’s most advanced AI means spending billions on data centers and other physical infrastructure to house and power the supercomputers needed for AI. It also means a drain on natural resources and the grid in the areas surrounding data centers worldwide. Still, last week’s earnings reports made clear that tech firms are forging ahead. Google announced it was planning to spend $85bn on building out its AI and cloud infrastructure just in 2025 – $10bn more than it initially predicted. And the company expects that spending to increase again in 2026. For context, Google reported $94bn in revenue in the second quarter of this year. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said Google is in a “tight supply environment” when it comes to the infrastructure needed to support AI processing and compute. The results of this increased spending would still take years to be realized, he said. Google isn’t alone. Amazon has said it plans to spend $100bn in 2025 – the “vast majority” of which will go to powering the AI capabilities of its cloud division. As a point of comparison, Amazon spent just under $80bn in 2024. “Sometimes people make the assumption that if you’re able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component … that somehow it leads to less total spend in technology,” said Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy during an earnings call in February. “We’ve never seen that to be the case.” Meta, too, has upped the amount it plans to spend on AI infrastructure. In June, Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to spend “hundreds of billions” of dollars on building out a network of massive data centers across the US including one that the firm expects to be up and running in 2026. Originally, executives said the firm was projected to spend $65bn in 2025 but adjusted that to anywhere between $64bn and $72bn. Meta and Amazon report earnings this week. AI is coming for artists, can anything be done rein it in? Artificial intelligence companies have come under fire for cannibalizing creative industries. Artists have seen their work used without their permission as companies train their algorithms. Creative teams have shrunk and been laid off as parts of their work are being done by AI. “It will mean that 95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists, and creative professionals for today will easily, nearly instantly, and at almost no cost be handled by AI,” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has said. “No problem.” In response, coalitions of artists have launched several copyright lawsuits against the top AI companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google and Anthropic. The companies say that under the “fair use” doctrine they should be able to use copyrighted material for free and without consent. Artists, including names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, say the companies shouldn’t be able to profit off their work. So far, the AI companies are winning. Adobe, the software company best known for making creative tools such as Photoshop, says it’s trying to walk the line between developing useful AI programs and making sure artists aren’t getting the short end of the stick. The company has introduced two “creator-safe” tools, that aim to tackle issues around copyright and intellectual property. One is its Firefly AI model, which Adobe says is trained only on licensed or public-domain content. The other is the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which lets photographers and other visual artists indicate when they don’t want their work to be used to train AI and also lets them add credentials to their digital creations. Artists can “apply a signature to it in the same way that a photographer might sign a photo or a sculptor would etch their initials into a sculpture”, said Andy Parsons, a senior director at Adobe who oversees the company’s work on content authenticity. We spoke with Parsons about the burgeoning world of AI and what it means for creators. *** Q: What do you see as the biggest issues that creators and artists are facing with the advent of AI, and generative AI? I think there’s one prevailing issue, which is the concern that various AI techniques will compete with human ingenuity and with artists of all kinds. And that goes for agencies, publishers, individual creators. *** Q: Is Adobe Firefly one of the ways that Adobe is trying to address these problems and make sure that creators’ work is not ripped off? Yeah, absolutely. From the beginning of Adobe Firefly, we followed two guiding principles. One is to make sure that Adobe Firefly is not trained on publicly available content. It’s only trained on things that Adobe and the Firefly team have exclusive rights to use. That means that it can’t do certain things. It cannot make a photo of a celebrity, because that celebrity’s likeness we would consider guarded and potentially protected. The second thing we built in from the beginning is transparency, so knowing that something that comes out of Firefly was generated by AI. This is what we call content provenance, or content authenticity. It’s making clear something is a photograph or made by an individual artist as opposed to made by AI. *** Q: What is the Adobe Firefly trained on? It’s a combination of Adobe Stock and some licensed datasets. It’s trained on things that Adobe has clear rights to use in this manner. *** Q: How do tech companies like Adobe avoid copyrighted materials sneaking into the datasets? We have licensed and clear rights to all of the data that goes into that dataset. There’s an entire team devoted to trust, safety and assurances that the material is available to be used. We don’t crawl the open web, because as soon as you do that, you do risk potentially infringing on someone’s intellectual property. Our feeling is it’s not always the case that more training data is better. *** Q: What does the future of human creativity look like now that we’re living in this new world with generative AI? When it comes to content authenticity, there’s that “nutrition label” idea we sometimes talk about. If you walk into a food store, you have a fundamental right that’s fulfilled in most democratic societies, to know what’s in the food that you’re going to serve your family. And we think the same is true of digital content. We have a fundamental right to know what it is.

technology/2025/apr/05/australia-social-media-ban-trial-global-response-implementation,Australia’s social media ban is attracting global praise – but we’re no closer to knowing how it would work,"The smash hit Netflix show Adolescence, which explores a teenage murder fuelled by social media and toxic masculinity, has renewed calls for social media bans in some countries. One of the show’s stars this week said the UK should follow Australia’s lead in banning children aged under 16 from social media platforms. The ban has been praised in the US and UK, and is described as “world-leading” by the Australian government. Time magazine this week praised the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for a “remarkable” policy that was “politically uncontroversial” on the basis that both major parties supported it. Left unsaid was all the criticism raised by mental health groups, LGBTQ+ groups and other campaigners during the rushed process to pass the bill in parliament last year. The committee reviewing the bill only reviewed the legislation for a single day, despite over 15,000 submissions being received. Author Jonathan Haidt, who reportedly lobbied politicians in Australia to push the policy before it was adopted and privately dismissed critics of his approach, told the New York Times this week that “it’s going to work. It doesn’t have to be perfect at first, but within a few years it will be very good”. If it worked in Australia, it was going to go global “very quickly”, he said. But nine months out from the policy coming into effect, Australians are still in the dark about how our ban – which was passed by the parliament in November 2024 – will work. And that’s likely to remain the case up to the federal election on 3 May. A trial of age assurance technology is under way, with schoolchildren still being recruited to participate just weeks before the first report is due. The under-16s social media ban is due to come into effect in December, but the government faces a number of hurdles before then, including figuring out what tech to use, and whether the platforms – emboldened by the apparent backing of Donald Trump – will comply. The Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), a UK-based company recruited by the Albanese government to conduct an assessment of the technology used to determine whether people are the age they say they are when accessing social media, is due to provide a preliminary report to the government by the end of April. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter While the report is said to be on track to be delivered this month, Guardian Australia has confirmed this preliminary report will not be released publicly by the company. A spokesperson for the communications department said the report was never intended for public release and is designed “to afford procedural fairness to trial participants” on any changes that need to be made. The final report is due just two months after the preliminary report in June, before the communications minister – whoever it will be after the federal election – will get to decide which platforms it applies to, and what technology is appropriate. ACCS has begun recruitment of school-age children to test out the various technologies, but there is an education and consent process still under way. From there, schoolchildren will test out age estimation (where tech estimates how old a user is), assurance (where a parent or guardian confirms an age) and verification (using some sort of identity document verification) technologies. The children will act as “mystery shoppers” and attempt to access a purpose-built online platform through the various age assurance methods, documents released by ACCS state. This process leaves just weeks to get the trials conducted, analysed, and a final report prepared for government. The ban is not a major focus of the federal election campaign – it had bipartisan support, after the Coalition pushed for it for months until the Labor government relented. However, there are still major concerns over how the ban will work, and who is included. TikTok and Meta, for example, are angry over the carve out YouTube received. The government’s messaging on why this exemption was allowed has been mixed. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said last year that YouTube would be included in a range of services exempt from the ban on health and education grounds. But in the draft wording of the document that sets out what services are exempt, YouTube is granted an exemption on its own, while health and education services are another carve out. In response to questions in Senate estimates from the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young last month, the department said the exclusion was “consistent with broad community sentiment, which highlights the value of YouTube as a tool for education and learning”. Evidence shows most children under 13 accessing social media are accessing YouTube. A report from the eSafety commissioner last month stated more than 80% of children aged between eight and 12 are accessing social media, despite the current minimum age requirement being 13. However, this figure was largely skewed by children accessing YouTube, either by watching while logged out, or using a parent or carer’s account. When YouTube is excluded, the figure is closer to 44%. TikTok and Snapchat are second and third behind YouTube (68%) on 31% and 19%, respectively. It is also worth noting that the stakeholder advisory board overseeing the trial has some members who have long called for bans or restrictions on online pornography, and have called for online censorship. But missing from the board are digital rights and privacy groups. Those organisations have subsequently been invited to apply to join the stakeholder advisory board, after inquiries from Guardian Australia, but as of yet do not appear to be included. Whether all this results in a report that the government can rely upon and implement before the end of this year remains to be seen, as does whether the social media companies will be willing players. The inconsistent treatment of some platforms over others might lead to companies such as Meta – which has already approached the Trump administration over their treatment by the Australian government – to seek the US government to push back on the ban before it comes into effect. But this week, Albanese, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the ban was not up for negotiation.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/05/australia-social-media-ban-trial-global-response-implementation,Technology,2025-04-04T14:00:55Z,2
technology/commentisfree/2025/mar/08/skype-got-shouted-down-by-teams-and-zoom-but-it-revolutionised-human-connection,Skype got shouted down by Teams and Zoom. But it revolutionised human connection,"So Microsoft has decided to terminate Skype, the internet telephony company it bought in 2011 for $8.5bn (£6.6bn). Its millions of hapless users are to be herded into Microsoft Teams, a virtual encampment with a brain-dead aesthetic that makes even Zoom look cool. This eventuality had been telegraphed for quite a while but, even so, it comes as a jolt because Skype was a remarkable venture, and its demise closes a chapter of an interesting strand of technological history. The internet has been around for much longer than most people realise. It goes back to the 1960s and the creation of Arpanet, a military computer network that emerged after the US had its “Sputnik moment” – the awful realisation that the Soviet Union seemed to be racing ahead in the technology stakes. The design of Arpanet’s successor, the internet we use today, started in the early 1970s and it was first switched on in January 1983. The designers of the network were, from the outset, determined to avoid the limitations of earlier communication systems, particularly the analogue telephone network, which was optimised for voice, hopeless for digital signals and owned by corporations which resisted innovations that they themselves had not originated. So the new network would not have an owner or be optimised for any particular medium, and would therefore be more permissive than any earlier network. Anyone could access it, and create services that ran upon it, so long as their computers conformed to the protocols of the network. The result was the explosion of creativity – good and bad – that we are still living with today. What the internet’s designers had built was what a scholar later called “an architecture for permissionless innovation”; or, put another way, a global platform for springing surprises. The world wide web, created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s, was one of those surprises. But so too was something called VoIP (voice over internet protocol). Speech could be digitised (converted into ones and zeroes) and put into data packets which could be sent over the internet; and then, having reached their destination, converted back into audio. The result: free telephony to anywhere in the world! Skype was the first company to bring this magic to ordinary consumers. It was founded in 2003 by Janus Friis (a Dane) and Niklas Zennström (a Swede) and headquartered in Luxembourg; but the software that powered it was written by three Estonians who also wrote software for peer-to-peer file sharing. In 2005, eBay bought it for $2.6bn (£2bn). By 2006 it had 100m registered users and by 2009 was adding about 380,000 new users each day and generating around $740m (£575m) in annual revenue. So you could say that Skype was the first European company to reach US-level scale. At which point the inevitable happened: in 2011 Skype was bought by Microsoft and absorbed into the maw of the tech colossus. Many observers, including this columnist, wondered what Microsoft thought it was doing with its new toy. Last week’s news suggests that the company never quite figured it out. And in any event, once the pandemic arrived in 2020 and people started working from home, it was clear that Microsoft would need to have something to ward off the threat posed by Zoom. Skype conceivably could have been at the core of its response, but instead the decision was made to put all the energy into making Teams the behemoth’s answer to remote working. From then on, Skype was surplus to requirements and the die was cast. Before it disappears, though, it’s worth remembering what an energising newcomer it was on the scene two decades ago. Most people nowadays have no idea how closed and depressing telephony was in the analogue era. It was an industry run either by complacent, unresponsive and domineering monopolies (AT&amp;T in the US) or government agencies (the GPO in the UK). It could take months to get a telephone installed in your home. Phone calls were expensive and international calls positively prohibitive. I grew up in a country (Ireland) with a huge diaspora in a time when a phone call from the US meant only one thing: a death in the family. If emigrants kept in touch with the folks back home, it was only by letter and perhaps the odd parcel; never by phone. In rural Ireland, on the night before a son or a daughter departed for America or Australia, their family would sometimes hold a wake, because they assumed they would never hear their voices again. And now? The VoIP technology that Skype brought into people’s lives has been commoditised. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal offer unlimited – and free – audio (and video) connections with friends, families and colleagues all over the world. Phone calls that would once have bankrupted a family are made every day. Microsoft may not have found Skype useful in the end. But the rest of us certainly did.

technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa,How the roots of the ‘PayPal mafia’ extend to apartheid South Africa,"When Elon Musk’s arm shot out in a stiff arm salute at Donald Trump’s inaugural celebrations, startled viewers mostly drew the obvious comparison. But in the fired-up debate about Musk’s intent that followed, as the world’s richest man insisted he wasn’t trying to be a Nazi, speculation inevitably focused on whether his roots in apartheid-era South Africa offered an insight. In recent months Musk’s promotion of far-right conspiracy theories has grown, from a deepening hostility to democratic institutions to the recent endorsement of Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). He has taken an unhealthy interest in genetics while backing claims of a looming “white genocide” in his South African homeland and endorsing posts promoting the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Increasingly, his language and tone have come to echo the old South Africa. He is not alone. Musk is part of the “PayPal mafia” of libertarian billionaires with roots in South Africa under white rule now hugely influential in the US tech industry and politics. They include Peter Thiel, the German-born billionaire venture capitalist and PayPal cofounder, who was educated in a southern African city in the 1970s where Hitler was still openly venerated. Thiel, a major donor to Trump’s campaign, has been critical of welfare programs and women being permitted to vote as undermining capitalism. A 2021 biography of Thiel, called The Contrarian, alleged that as a student at Stanford he defended apartheid as “economically sound”. David Sacks, formerly PayPal’s chief operating officer and now a leading fundraiser for Trump, was born in Cape Town and grew up within the South African diaspora after his family moved to the US when he was young. A fourth member of the mafia, Roelof Botha, the grandson of the apartheid regime’s last foreign minister, Pik Botha, and former PayPal CFO, has kept a lower political profile but remains close to Musk. Among them, Musk stands out for his ownership of X, which is increasingly a platform for far-right views, and his proximity to Trump, who has nominated Musk to head a “department of government efficiency” to slash and burn its way through the federal bureaucracy. Some draw a straight line between Musk’s formative years atop a complex system of racial hierarchy as a white male, in a country increasingly at war with itself as the South African government became ever more repressive as resistance to apartheid grew, and the man we see at Trump’s side today. The week before the inauguration, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser, described white South Africans as the “most racist people on earth”, questioned their involvement in US politics and said Musk was a malign influence who should go back to the country of his birth. Others are sceptical that Musk’s increasingly extreme views can be tracked back to his upbringing in Pretoria. The acclaimed South African writer Jonny Steinberg recently called attempts to explain Musk through his childhood under apartheid “a bad idea” that resulted in “facile” conclusions. But for those looking to join dots, there is fodder from Musk’s early life with a neo-Nazi grandfather who moved from Canada to South Africa because he liked the idea of apartheid through his high school education in a system infused with the ideology of white supremacy. Musk’s formative years in the 1980s came amid a cauldron of rebellion in the Black townships which drew a state of emergency and a bloody crackdown by the state. Some whites fled the country. Others marched with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement against any weakening of apartheid. The South Africa into which Musk was born in 1971, and to which Thiel moved as a child from Germany, was led by a prime minister, John Vorster, who had been a general in a fascist militia three decades earlier that allied itself with Hitler. The Ossewabrandwag (OB) was founded shortly before the second world war. It opposed South Africa entering the war as an ally of Britain and plotted with German military intelligence to assassinate the prime minster, Jan Smuts, as a prelude to an armed uprising in support of Hitler. Vorster made no secret of his sympathy for Nazi, or National Socialist, ideology which he compared to the Afrikaner political philosophy of Christian nationalism. “We stand for Christian nationalism which is an ally of National Socialism,” he said in 1942. “You can call this anti-democratic principle dictatorship if you wish. In Italy it is called ‘Fascism’, in Germany ‘German National Socialism’ and in South Africa ‘Christian nationalism’.” Smuts’s government took a dim view of that and a few weeks later interned Vorster as a Nazi sympathiser. At the end of the war, the OB was absorbed into the National party, which then won the 1948 election, in which Black South Africans had no vote, on a commitment to impose apartheid. In 1961, Vorster joined the government as minister of justice and five years later became prime minister. Nazism may have been defeated in Europe but Christian nationalism was alive and kicking in South Africa under Vorster, with its own brand of racial classification and stratification justified by the need to keep the “swart gevaar”, or black danger, at bay. In schools, Christian nationalist education sought to forge a South African identity around a singular version of the country’s history. Musk and Thiel were taught that the Afrikaner, mostly the descendants of Dutch colonisers, was the real victim of South Africa’s strife whether at the hands of grasping British imperialists or treacherous Zulu chiefs. Bea Roberts, who grew up in an apartheid-supporting family but came to oppose the system and later worked for the Institute for a Democratic South Africa, remembers a heavy emphasis on Afrikaners as victims pursuing apartheid in order to protect their culture and even their very existence. “It was a strange mix of ‘we got fucked up by the British in the [second Boer] war, and our women and children died in thousands in the concentration camps’ so we are going to rebuild our nation and make sure that that we are invincible. And we’ll do that by extreme means,” she said. Schooling, like much else, was segregated by race for most of the apartheid era and, on paper at least, white pupils across South Africa were subject to the same Christian nationalist education. But white society was itself divided and the historical narrative embraced in Afrikaans-speaking schools could often became the basis for an implicit rejection of apartheid philosophy in English-speaking ones. Musk attended a Johannesburg high school and then the Pretoria boys high school, an institution whose other alumni include students who went on to become leading anti-apartheid activists such as Edwin Cameron, a South African supreme court justice after the collapse of white rule, and Peter Hain, who moved to Britain, where he became a leading campaigner against apartheid and then a Labour government minister. Phillip Van Niekerk, former editor of the leading anti-apartheid Mail and Guardian newspaper in Johannesburg, had Afrikaner parents but attended an English-speaking school. He recalled that the official version of history did little to engender support for the apartheid system among a lot of English speakers even if they benefited from it and did little to challenge it. “We hated the National party government. Even our teachers were kind of hostile. It was seen almost like an imposition. Yet you imbibe things through the culture. The truth is we didn’t see Black people quite as equals. We didn’t think about it,” he said. Thiel got all that and more at schools in South Africa and its de facto colony, South West Africa, which became independent as Namibia in 1990. South West Africa had been a German colony until the end of the first world war and Thiel lived for a time in the city of Swakopmund, where he attended a German-language school while his father worked at a nearby uranium mine. At that time, Swakopmund was notorious for its continued glorification of Nazism, including celebrating Hitler’s birthday. In 1976, the New York Times reported that some people in the town continued to greet each other with “Heil Hitler” and to give the Nazi salute. Van Niekerk visited Swakopmund during South African rule. “I was there in the 1980s and you could walk into a curio shop and buy mugs with Nazi swastikas on them. If you’re German and you’re in Swakopmund in the 1970s, which is when Thiel was there, you’re part of that community,” he said. Thiel, who moved to the US when he was 10, has described his schooling in Swakopmund as instilling a dislike of regimentation that steered him towards libertarianism. Thiel’s father worked at a uranium mine in Rössing where, as in the gold and coalmines of the Reef around Johannesburg, Black laborers were paid just enough to survive, living conditions were dire and the work dangerous. White managers, on the other hand, lived a lifestyle of neo-colonial luxury with servants at the ready. Musk’s father, Errol, was also in the mining business among other interests. He once boasted that his stake in Zambian emerald mines made him “so much money we couldn’t even close our safe”. Musk’s mother, Maye, has said the family owned two homes, a plane, a yacht and a handful of luxury cars. Errol Musk has said that he opposed apartheid and joined the Progressive Federal party but then left because he didn’t like its demand for one person, one vote, and instead favored a more gradual reform with separate parliaments for different races. That was the liberal position inside the Musk family. Musk’s maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, moved from Canada to South Africa in 1950 because he liked the newly elected apartheid government. In the 1930s, Haldeman was the Canadian leader of a fringe political movement originating in the US, Technocracy Incorporated, that advocated abolishing democracy in favor of government by elite technicians but which took on overtones of fascism with its uniforms and salutes. The Canadian government banned Technocracy Incorporated during the second world war as a threat to the country’s security in part for its opposition to fighting Hitler. Haldeman was charged with publishing documents opposing the war and sent to prison for two months. After the war, Haldeman led a separate political party that among other things promoted the antisemitic forgery the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. When that went nowhere, he moved to South Africa because he said he liked the core National party philosophy of Christian nationalism that Vorster likened to Nazism. Errol Musk described Maye’s parents as so extreme he stopped visiting them. “They were very fanatical in favor of apartheid,” he told Podcast and Chill. “Her parents came to South Africa from Canada because they sympathised with the Afrikaner government. They used to support Hitler and all that sort of stuff.” Haldeman was killed in a plane crash when Elon was three years old but the boy remained close to his grandmother and mother. He is estranged from his father, whom Maye has described as abusive of her and their children. Errol Musk once claimed to have shot and killed three people who broke into his house. Musk has described his father as a “terrible human being”. “Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done,” he told Rolling Stone without elaborating in 2017. What is indisputable is that Musk and Thiel grew up amid incredible privilege where the racial hierarchy was clear. Those who claimed to reject apartheid sought to explain this privilege not as the result of systemic racial oppression but the natural order of things thanks to their own abilities. That in turn led some to regard all forms government as oppressive and true liberty as an individual battle for survival. The biography of Thiel said he held a view common among apartheid’s supporters at the time that Black South Africans were better off than Africans in other parts of the continent even if they were systematically denied their rights. Thiel has denied ever having supported apartheid. Van Niekerk said that opposition to apartheid did not necessarily mean rejection of white supremacy or privilege, a point made in a 1968 British television documentary the year before Thiel was born. The commentary observed that the English-speaking mining barons and other industrialists in Johannesburg usually claimed to be “hostile to apartheid, call themselves liberal” but did little to oppose the system while profiting from it. Helen Suzman, at the time a member of the South African parliament who was often a lone voice in opposition to apartheid, was critical of these powerful industrialists and businessmen, saying “people who do nothing are responsible”. She accused them of hiding behind apartheid to exploit Black workers. “I see no reason why the industrialists should not improve the living conditions of their workers,” she said. In the documentary, Stanley Cohen, the managing director of the OK Bazaars supermarket chain owned by his family, was asked why he only employed whites behind the counter and no South Africans of other races even though many of the customers were Black. Cohen acknowledged that it was not a legal requirement, but did it to indulge the racist prejudices of white customers. “There is no reason why they [Black people] can’t work behind the counters. There’s no law against it. But there is this natural prejudice in this country which you can’t legislate for or against,” he said. A decade later, power was shifting. The uprising that began in Soweto in 1976 had become a full-blown national crisis for the apartheid system by the 1980s. A low-level civil war was under way. In response, the state grew even more violent and repressive. White paranoia was fed by the creep of independent Black African states under Marxist-leaning governments ever closer to South Africa’s borders, with Angola and Mozambique in the 1970s followed by Zimbabwe in 1980. Talk of white genocide emerged, a conspiracy theory that has taken on new life in recent times with the killings of white farmers in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Support surged for the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), or Afrikaner Resistance Movement, founded in the early 1970s to oppose any relaxation of apartheid. The AWB, founded by Eugene Terre’Blanche, an imposing and flamboyant figure given to riding around on a horse from which he occasionally fell off, made no secret of its model with a badge strikingly similar to a swastika in design and colors. It’s supporters were also fond of the stiff-armed Hitler salute as they paraded on the streets of Pretoria. At its peak, the AWB appeared to have the support of more than 10% of white South Africans. Roberts said life for privileged whites in particular was “definitely a bubble, and one filled with self-belief”. But she said that it became increasingly difficult to ignore reality. “I think Musk in Pretoria in the 1980s must have had a sense of what Black people were experiencing and why they were angry. I grew up fairly conservative but I was able to change my views. I think you have to be fairly rigid in the 80s to still cling on to the belief that the apartheid system was fine and correct and in everybody’s best interest,” she said. Musk left South Africa in 1988 in the midst of this ferment, two years before FW de Klerk carved out a path to freedom by releasing Nelson Mandela. Had he stayed, Musk faced being conscripted into the military for two years, an obligatory service for white men, that could well have meant fighting in the “border war” in Angola and Namibia or being sent to put down Black protests in the townships. Instead, Musk took Canadian citizenship through his mother and moved to Ontario. Van Niekerk said that, whether he wants to admit it or not, Musk also took a part of South Africa with him. “We all [white South Africans], by the very nature of our privileges and our place in the racial hierarchy, grew up believing we were the master race, even if we didn’t actively think about it,” he said.

technology/2025/jan/25/tech-right-trump-inauguration,‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right,"On Inauguration Day, fans of the All-In Podcast gathered in a billiards room in Washington DC to watch Donald Trump’s swearing-in – and a few miles away, the podcast co-host and PayPal Mafia alum David Sacks prepared to ascend to his role as Trump’s AI and crypto czar. Very popular in Silicon Valley, All-In is fiercely pro-capitalism and enthusiastic about the world of tech start-ups and investments. Last summer, its co-hosts, Sacks and Jason Calacanis in particular, became vocal in their support for Trump and attempted to rally other tech leaders, including their listeners, behind the candidate. Now, Sacks has a seat at the table in the White House, as do many others in tech, including a former Uber executive, a senior adviser at Palantir, and a PayPal co-founder, who was picked to be ambassador to Denmark (Greenland, a territory Trump wants to seize, is part of Denmark). It’s a watershed moment for relationships between Silicon Valley and Washington and, more broadly, what’s often described as the tech right. The watch party was lightly attended – aside from the host, just three men who worked in tech and one woman who’d grown up in Silicon Valley showed up – but the atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. They laughed at the spectacle of Trump calling for the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the Gulf of America (Trump would sign an executive order about this hours later). One man cheered when Trump talked about planting an American flag on Mars, and the camera panned to Elon Musk (hours later, Musk would deny that he had made two Nazi salutes at an inauguration event). As the speech wound down, one man heard a noise from the street: at least hundreds of people chanting in support of Palestinian liberation were passing by. They watched quietly from the windows for a few moments. “That’s their right!” the man said as he walked back to the TV. “Freedom of speech!” Galas, conventions and watch parties During inauguration weekend, the news was dominated by headlines about the tech elite – Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman and others – wining and dining a second Trump administration. Their alignment with Trump seems in part protective, an attempt to avoid being targeted by regulators or prosecutors. (Consider Zuckerberg’s recent pivot to supporting Trump, who had threatened to throw him in prison.) Outside the billionaire class, a hodgepodge of tech-adjacent people also came to town to celebrate at glamorous galas, conventions and watch parties – some of which I was able to attend. Compared with the average Trump voter, this crowd tends to be more animated by industry-specific issues than talking points, about, say, illegal immigration. The crypto community rallied behind Trump after his reversal on Bitcoin, shifting from calling it a scam to embracing light regulation. It has some overlap with the libertarian-leaning supporters of Robert F Kennedy Jr, who are similarly skeptical of centralized authority while also more likely to embrace offbeat ideas about health and wellness. Silicon Valley’s power players and venture capitalists have argued that Democrats don’t support the tech industry any more. The defense tech industry thinks Trump’s enthusiastic positions on defense, energy and AI will create a particularly lucrative environment. Many people in the tech right also resonate with the socially conservative world of the “new right” and its openness toward, to put it mildly, reactionary politics. Most people I met over inauguration weekend were ecstatic about Trump 2.0. At the very worst, they felt cautious optimism. And they seldom expressed concern about the friendliness between Washington and the richest people and companies on earth, or what that may mean for ordinary Americans. Quantum fields and interplanetary cash I arrived at the Maga Maha Crypto Conference on Saturday morning just in time for the second panel of the day: “Sustainable living earth autonomy and regeneration”, which mainly argued that we can manifest better biological outcomes for ourselves. “We have enormous power to genetically create these bodies,” said the opening panelist Ken Close, who was introduced as a doctor and appears to be a member of the “holistic wellbeing” group Healy World. “Is it how much sleep you get? No. Is it what you have for breakfast? No. It is a frequency, it is an intelligence,” Close said. Specifically, he said, it is “waveforms” in the “quantum field”. “Figure out what that frequency is, and how you control it as the puppeteer of your body,” he said. This set the tone for a conference of wildly diverse ideologies. Maha, Kennedy’s tagline “make America healthy again”, is a platform that’s both anti-processed food and anti-vaccine. As it happens, many crypto enthusiasts also supported Kennedy’s presidential campaign, and after he endorsed Trump and set himself up to become the new administration’s health secretary, Kennedy’s fans opted to join the Maga movement. At another panel, Nick Spanos, a former Ron Paul campaign worker and current Bitcoin advocate, alternated between a grave and somewhat facetious tone. While he said he hoped for decentralized crypto governance under Trump (meaning no Bitcoin strategic reserve and limited regulation of crypto generally), he didn’t believe it would happen. Instead, Spanos imagined a dystopian future. “They’re probably gonna pop out another virus,” he claimed. Presumably due to Musk’s proximity to Trump, he predicted Musk’s Neuralink brain chips would become necessary to making a decent income but would eventually be hacked, turning us into “zombies running around in the woods”. His co-panelist Andre Soriano, a fashion designer, said that the future of America was “brighter than ever”. “We have Elon Musk, he’s so fascinating,” Soriano said. “We’re all in God’s hands now, and everything is so exciting.” Next to the stage, there were displays for a new blockchain network called Gajumaru, an “interplanetary cash for the next 5,000 years” that would work both on the moon and Mars. Toward the back, I stood by a table displaying CDs by the Christian singer Stephen W Tenner, including a single called ThanQ for Coming. Shortly before I left, I was handed a rhinestone “MAGAVERSE” pin by a woman named Joanne who passionately explained it was a crypto asset project started by her friend and had recently donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Some time soon, she said, she hoped to quit her job as a physician’s assistant and work in crypto full-time. I recognized the logo on Joanne’s pin from the night before. Around the corner from the Crypto Ball, I’d taken a picture of a Cybertruck with an American flag car wrap and giant text reading MAGAVERSE. Creating a military ‘hellscape’ Crypto isn’t the only sector of the tech industry that’s thinking about how business may change under Trump. On Sunday afternoon, I met up with Neil Keegan, the co-founder and CEO of Marlinspike, an investment firm largely focused on defense tech companies. Keegan had recently co-hosted one of the many business conferences that have taken place at Mar-a-Lago (Trump hasn’t been in attendance). On Sunday, he had just come from a “victory lunch” hosted by Vivek Ramaswamy, alongside 50 or so tech executives and investors whom Keegan called “very thoughtful patriots”. This was a day before Ramaswamy stepped down from his role co-leading Trump’s planned “department of government efficiency” with Musk to run for governor of Ohio. According to Keegan, a big priority for US defense agencies and contractors, after 20 years of fighting primarily guerilla warfare in the Middle East, will be “rearming and rebuilding” in order to prepare to fight directly with “our peers”,such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. Keegan said that autonomous systems would have to supplement US soldiers – “underwater drones, surface drones, aerial drones, hypersonic missiles, everything. “The strategy is really to create what’s called a hellscape. So a hellscape of drones and missiles, and just everything happening at once to make it super difficult,” he said. “You’ve got to be able to react very quickly, and I think AI is the only way to do it in the future hellscape.” Hours later, at the Coronation Ball thrown by Passage Press, I ran into a man who’d written a series of essays arguing against the logic of “AI doomerism”, or the belief that an AI superintelligence presents a significant risk to human civilization. We talked for a few minutes about the vibe shift happening in DC, and how strange it is to see open collaboration between Washington and the tech elite. “It’s culturally and politically unprecedented,” he said. The ball thrown by Passage Press – a controversial rightwing publishing outlet associated with the “new right” and known for platforming writers such as Curtis Yarvin, who describes himself as anti-democracy and pro-monarchy, and Steve Sailer, best known for his racist writings – was billed as “Maga meets the tech right”. I didn’t have a ticket, but I did have a dinner reservation in the venue’s restaurant and was able to walk in with a group of attendees. Waiters wove through the packed ballroom passing out champagne and deviled eggs. In one corner, an enormous St Bernard lounged on the floor near its owner. I saw a man who looked remarkably like Peter Thiel. Eventually, a woman working the event asked to see the check-in stamp on my wrist. I said I didn’t have one and was escorted out. Afterward, I learned from social media that Passage Press had passed out cards to attendees noting their “historic electoral victory”. “We now have a rare opportunity to reassert our industrial might, our creative dynamism, and reclaim our culture,” the cards read. The event sponsor Remilia, which sells NFTs of anime avatars in streetwear, gave out stickers showing one of its characters in jail, captioned with the slur “Canceled Retard”. At the afterparty, Steve Bannon took control of the DJ booth and played YMCA by the Village People. At the Crypto Inaugural Ball Perhaps nothing better represented Trump’s open alliance with the tech right than the Crypto Inaugural Ball on Friday night – a black-tie gala that brought together Silicon Valley hotshots, Maga heavyweights and crypto fanatics. The conference was organized in part by Bitcoin Inc and Stand With Crypto, a political group that supported pro-crypto candidates running in 2024 (many of whom won). Tickets cost $2,500 on the low end, and $100,000 for VIPs; merch areas gave out red “Make Bitcoin great again” hats, and the menu included lobster rolls and McDonald’s. The vast majority of attendees were men – notably, guests weren’t entitled to a plus-one – who rubbed shoulders with Donald Trump Jr; the House speaker, Mike Johnson; the incoming US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent; and the far-right provocateur Lara Loomer, who spent a strange few weeks last summer traveling on Trump’s jet. All four hosts of the All-In Podcast were in attendance too, bearing gigantic grins in group photos they posted on X. “The reign of terror against crypto is over,” Sacks said in a jubilant speech, to cheers from the audience. “And the beginning of innovation in America for crypto has just begun.” But the highlight of the night was arguably a performance by Snoop Dogg – who in 2017 had harshly criticized artists who performed at Trump’s first inauguration – followed by Rick Ross and Soulja Boy. As they performed, Trump made a surprise drop of his own crypto asset called Trump Meme, or $TRUMP. It shot up in value instantly, only to nosedive quickly after. Some people in crypto have since called it an industry “mockery”. A few days after the Crypto Ball, I talked to a soft-spoken middle-aged man sitting next to me at a restaurant, who said his name was Nate. He’d driven 10 hours from Michigan to see Trump be inaugurated. He wasn’t the type to buy a ticket to a Crypto Ball. Nate said he was an early investor in Bitcoin and had been living conservatively for many years, holding on to his remaining Bitcoin and living with his mom on a budget of $115 per week. That night, he ordered an expensive charcuterie board and a huge piece of steak.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/25/tech-right-trump-inauguration,Technology,2025-01-25T12:00:21Z,2
technology/2025/jan/16/uk-meta-staff-concerned-over-scrapping-of-factcheckers-and-dei-programmes,UK Meta staff ‘concerned’ over scrapping of factcheckers and DEI programmes,"UK staff at Facebook owner Meta feel “concerned” and “let down” about the company’s decision to scrap factcheckers and diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, the trade union representing UK tech workers has warned the firm. The Prospect union, which represents a growing number of UK Meta employees, has written to Meta to express staff concern about the impact of the controversial decisions by chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. “Staff of many years’ service at Meta have highlighted how incredibly let down they feel by their employer’s change of tone,” wrote Prospect assistant secretary Andrew Sturtevant to Meta. He added: “Our members are concerned over Meta’s future direction and the potential impact of policy changes on employees and on the company’s reputation.” In a letter addressed to Lizzie Runham, Meta’s HR director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Sturtevant warned the company it may struggle to hire and keep staff in light of recent announcements. It comes as Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, is planning to cut about 5% of its global workforce, with its poorest-performing employees most likely to leave. The move could affect about 3,600 employees globally amid a shake-up to Meta’s performance management system, as it plans to “move out low-performers faster”. UK employees “believe that Meta’s ability to attract and retain talent in the UK, and to thrive as an inclusive business, will be severely impacted” by its change of approach, Sturtevant wrote in the letter. Meta employed 6,338 people in the UK at the end of 2023, according to the most recent accounts for Facebook UK, after cutting more than 700 roles. Prospect is seeking assurances from Meta that staff members with protected characteristics, especially those from the LGBTQ+ community, will not be disadvantaged by the company’s policy changes, and is calling on the company to engage with the union. The union is also asking Meta to reassure staff with protected characteristics that “they will not find themselves arbitrarily placed in a performance process, and that they can have confidence that Meta will be a safe and inclusive place to pursue their careers”. Workers are also afraid that changes to moderation guidelines announced earlier this month, which include the scrapping of third-party factcheckers, and moves to include more political content on Meta’s platforms could mean they have to engage with “more content that is demeaning and ridiculing in nature, and that this will create a hostile working environment for them”, the letter added. Employees have told the union that Meta’s previous code of conduct and other company policies “intended to create a respectful, meritorious workplace and a culture” that had driven the success of Meta and was “shared by staff and shareholders”. Citing the government’s employment rights bill, which is making its way through parliament and will oblige employers to protect their workers from sexual harassment, the union has asked Meta to explain what “level of consultation and risk assessment” was carried out to ensure that staff with protected characteristics would be not be adversely affected. The union’s letter came just days after Zuckerberg appeared on the popular podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, where the 40-year-old billionaire shared his view that workplaces require more “masculine energy”. Meta has been contacted for comment.",tech,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/16/uk-meta-staff-concerned-over-scrapping-of-factcheckers-and-dei-programmes,Technology,2025-01-16T16:46:07Z,2
technology/2025/jan/13/metas-ditching-of-factcheckers-is-potentially-dangerous-and-a-disservice,Meta’s ditching of factcheckers is potentially dangerous and a disservice,"Meta’s move to scrap factcheckers is not about “complexity”, as it says (Report, 8 January), but to support Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s agenda. It is widely agreed that effective, fast and unbiased factchecking is essential for the proper functioning of social media platforms. Similarly, principles of free speech are foundational to fostering communication and public debate in a healthy democratic society. Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that Meta is to follow X in introducing user-generated notes raises serious concerns. The shift will intensify pressures on vulnerable groups, including children, minorities, gender rights advocates and LGBTQ+ communities, who are already targeted by hate speech. Additionally, it risks deepening societal polarisation and further fragmenting public discourse. If Meta truly aspires to be a deliberative space driven by a “global collective consciousness that keeps each other accountable” – as suggested by Linda Yaccarino, the head of X – the company must establish structures that penalise coercion, foster reciprocity and ensure that diverse voices are heard. Moreover, robust systems of accountability must be implemented to ensure credibility and trust. Meta’s oversight board and previous factchecking system were steps towards enhancing the quality of deliberation. However, it appears that Trump’s agenda is now overriding the vision of individuals such as Noah Feldman, and even Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who have advocated for Meta creating a better society. This regression is not only a disservice to its users, but also a threat to democratic values.

world/2025/oct/19/black-colombians-palenque-freed-slavery,Historic town founded by Black Colombians fleeing slavery eyes second ‘independence’,"The Caribbean Colombian village that proudly calls itself “the first free Black territory in the Americas” is on the verge of freeing itself once again – not from the Spanish crown, as it did in the early 18th century, but from local government control. Just over 300 years after Spain recognised San Basilio de Palenque as a slavery-free territory, residents of the community, just 30 miles away from the touristic hub of Cartagena, are set to vote on finally becoming an independent town. Young people rehearse their musical performance for the night of the Drum festival in San Basilio de Palenque Ronny Farley, 13, a member of the group Son Caliente, practices for his performance at the Drum festival Youth groups and folkloric group performs at the Drum festival The town is the most famous Colombian palenque – the name given to communities formed by formerly enslaved people who escaped bondage – and is home to about 4,000 residents. Despite its historical significance – recognised by Unesco as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2005 – Palenque is at the moment no more than a division of another municipality, Mahates. The town even has its own language, Palenquero, a mix of Spanish, Portuguese and African Bantu languages such as Kikongo and Kimbundu. “Those who speak only Portuguese, Spanish or central African languages can’t understand Palenquero because it’s a unique language that mixes all of them,” said Manuel Pérez Salinas, 50, director of San Basilio de Palenque’s Drum and Cultural Expressions festival, which held its 40th edition last weekend. Manuel Pérez Salinas explains a phrase in the Palenquero language But even as the village edges closer to its second “independence”, there is a sharp contrast between its cultural and historic significance and the profound lack of basic public services such as running water and sanitation. Through the heart of the district, only a handful of streets are paved, and empty lots serve as improvised rubbish dumps. The dirt roads, often occupied by chickens – sometimes perched on a rooftop – and piglets, contrast with the vibrant colours of the house facades, many of which are adorned with astonishing murals depicting local historical figures. Around San Basilio, there is graffiti depicting Afro-descendant people with words or phrases in the Palenquero language On 30 November a referendum asking whether residents agree to becoming a town is expected to win broad approval from its inhabitants, who largely see administrative and budgetary autonomy as a way to improve the community. But there is also some apprehension, as the change would lead the centuries-old community to face unprecedented challenges, such as holding its first-ever mayoral election. “Becoming a city is something positive because it will bring more autonomy to the people, but it could also divide the community,” said Bernardino Pérez, 25, a community narrator who produces videos about Palenquero culture. Like all his siblings, he was also given an “African name” by his father: Ashanty. Bernardino Pérez, also known as Ashanty, is 25 years old and is a community communicator and narrator from San Basilio de Palenque “As a community, we’re trying to talk things through to avoid divisions, but it’s almost impossible not to have differing opinions because we still don’t have a clear idea of how the new municipality will work,” said Pérez. It remains unclear what form its new political organisation will take in the village, which is now headed by a council-led community board. Next month’s referendum is one of the final steps in that process, but there is still no indication of when the city will hold its first local elections. “We also still don’t know, for instance, what will happen to our ancestral justice system,” said Pérez, referring to the Guardia Cimarrona, an unarmed guard made up of community members responsible for social order, conflict mediation and security, as there is no police station or battalion in the village. Young people practise traditional dances from the community. These musical styles and dances have their roots in African rhythms Cimarrón was the term used by Spanish colonisers to refer to enslaved and formerly enslaved people who rebelled and fled to form palenques. With its strategic location on the Caribbean, Cartagena was one of the main ports for goods and enslaved Africans under the Spanish crown in the Americas. The historic center of Cartagena is only 30 miles away. In the early 17th century, a group of enslaved people led by Benkos Biohó, believed to have been born in Guinea-Bissau, escaped inland and founded one of the first versions of San Basilio de Palenque, which would not be officially recognised by the Spanish crown until more than a century later, through an agreement in 1713. The name, in reference to Basil of Caesarea, came soon after. To this day, Palenqueros refer to the village either as San Basilio de Palenque, Palenque de San Basilio or simply Palenque, although there is a growing movement to call it Palenque de Benkos: not after a white saint, but a Black leader. “Benkos was our liberator and one of the greatest figures in Black history – not only in Colombia, but in the world,” said Salinas, who last weekend delivered his opening speech at the drum festival just metres from a statue of Benkos in the central square. The town was founded in 1603 by enslaved people who fled Cartagena and settled in this inaccessible region. The main leader of this rebellion was Benkos Biohó The commemorative plaque on the statue of Benkos Biohó Just below the statue lies a clear symbol of Mahates city hall’s neglect of its soon-to-be former district: the story of Benkos inscribed on the stone is barely legible because roughly one-sixth of the plaque has broken off. For historian and writer Javier Ortiz Cassiani, author of a book on Afro-Colombian history, although there is little historical documentation about Benkos, he “became a mythical figure and a symbol that evokes not only Palenque’s memory of resistance, but that of Black resistance across the Colombian Caribbean and throughout what is today the Republic of Colombia”. The historian also notes that the title “the first free Black territory in the Americas” is still disputed and is likewise claimed by Yanga, in Mexico, also founded by formerly enslaved people and which, chronologically, was recognised by the Spanish crown earlier than Palenque, in the 17th century. Javier Ortiz Cassiani, 54 years old, is a historian, university professor, writer and columnist “The construction of Palenque as the ‘first free territory’ is political and stems much more from a memory of resistance than from empirical evidence,” said Cassiani. “In the end, the struggle to recover and affirm that history is one of reclaiming humanity. The logic of enslavement was dehumanisation, so the fight has always been to regain that humanity,” he added. That effort has also involved the recovery of Palenque’s own language. It is said that the Palenquero language emerged as a kind of secret code through which the cimarrones discussed escape plans and devised military strategies to resist attacks from colonial forces. Most recently, however, the language came under a different threat. Due to a lack of opportunities, many residents had to leave the village in search of work in other cities, where they faced discrimination for speaking their native tongue. “People said we spoke a broken form of Spanish,” said philologist and Palenquero teacher Regina Miranda Reyes, 59. “We were discriminated against for having a language of African ancestry, but we never gave up speaking it,” she said. Regina Miranda Reyes is a cultural leader and one of the founders of the Drum festival. She offers guided tours at the Museum of Drums and Palenque Cultural Expressions Regina Miranda shows a book of Afro-inspired poems related to San Basilio de Palenque At the end of the 1990s, Palenquero was included in the village school curriculum, and today it is estimated that more than half the population speaks it. On a walk through the village streets, one hears both Palenquero and Spanish. Part of that revival, especially among young people, is also attributed to the local rap group Kombilesa Mi, which performs in Palenquero. “Our culture, which goes beyond the language itself, had been fading, but there’s been a great effort to reclaim it through tradition and oral history, and we’ve been seeking it from our grandparents,” said Lauriana Hernández Pérez, 50, who was born and raised in San Basilio de Palenque but now lives in Cartagena, where she runs a shop selling African clothing. Two women pose in front of their stall displaying products from their local business. Products for sale are related to African elements, figures, symbols or representations that speak of ancestors The diaspora in search of opportunity is still common – its most visible expression may be the dozens of Palenquera women, dressed in bright gowns and headwraps, balancing baskets of fruit on their heads as they pose for photos with tourists in Cartagena – and it will be one of many challenges awaiting the new city’s first mayor. Currently an impoverished district, Palenque will, like any Colombian municipality, receive direct transfers from the federal government, though the amount remains uncertain. The new administration may also have to begin collecting local taxes to address the shortage of public services. Andreus Manuel Valdés Torre, 46, a community leader of San Basilio de Palenque, in a Palenquero language workshop “Obviously, there will be challenges,” said community leader Andreus Manuel Valdés Torre, 46. “But we’re trying to educate, train and prepare people to face those challenges as best as possible, without physical, verbal or social conflict. “We hope it will become a model municipality for all of Colombia – and, why not, for the Americas as well,” he added.",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/19/black-colombians-palenque-freed-slavery,World news,2025-10-19T09:00:10Z,27
world/2025/oct/17/trump-caribbean-venezuela-trinidad-boat-strikes,‘Trump is killing poor people’: Caribbean village mourns victim of US strike,"Relatives of two men from Trinidad believed to have been killed in a US military strike on a boat in the Caribbean have accused Donald Trump of “killing poor people” without due process and are demanding justice. Chad “Charpo” Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, from the fishing village of Las Cuevas in northern Trinidad, are thought to be among six people killed in a US airstrike on a boat allegedly transporting drugs from Venezuela. Trump has described the six killed as “narcoterrorists”, claiming that “intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics”. But speaking to the Guardian at a wake for the two men, Joseph’s cousin La Toya, 42, said he was denied the basic right to due process and accused the Trinidad and Tobago government of giving up its sovereignty to the US. “Everybody have a right to due process and due process wasn’t given. It don’t look like we running under our government no more when it comes to the waters – that’s not Trinidad waters,” she said, questioning why US officials decided to destroy the boat rather than detain and question its occupants. At a wake for the two men late on Thursday, family and community members said they felt betrayed by their own government and at the mercy of a Trump administration that has been given unfettered access to their waters. “I just want to know why Donald Trump killing poor people just so,” Joseph’s uncle, known only as “Dollars”, said. “Just because he going after the people gas and their oil. He going after people riches and killing poor people children.” Lynette Burnley, Joseph’s aunt, said the family had received no communication from the Trinidad government since reports of her nephew’s death first emerged. “That make me feel a kind of way too,” Burnley said. “People coming from international, all over, [calling us but] not right here in Trinidad. They real poor, they let us down.” On Thursday, Trinidad’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who has previously expressed strong support for a US military operation in the region, avoided questions from reporters about the US airstrike that is thought to have killed Joseph and Samaroo. “Just imagine, the prime minister … They asking she about this. She never even make a statement,” Burnley said, adding that it felt as if Joseph and Samaroo were being treated like “they did not exist”. Joseph’s grandmother Christine Clement said she was very close to him. He moved from his mother’s home in another fishing village, Matelot, and came to live with her. She said the only support she had had was from the community. “Everybody hurt, because in this community everybody is family and friends and everybody close … Our own police service, nobody come and ask a question. There’s no investigation, nothing,” she said, adding she was trying to stay calm and monitor her blood pressure. Less is known in the village about Samaroo, who was released from prison in 2021 after serving time for his role in a 2009 murder of a street vendor. Most only knew him by his last name and said he would often try to help out in any way he could with odd jobs and mechanics, but especially animals. With no body to bury, family and friends are planning a memorial mass. “I talked to the priest and I let him know what went on,” Burnley said. “Next week Wednesday will be the nine days. He coming home here to keep a mass, five o’clock.” On Thursday, US media reported another strike on a boat in the Caribbean, from which there reportedly are survivors. At least 27 people have been killed in previous attacks off the coast of Venezuela, which the Trump administration says are necessary to protect the United States from narcotics smuggled from Venezuela, but which UN experts and human rights groups have described as extrajudicial killings. Last month, fishers in Las Cuevas told the Guardian that they were afraid of being caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s “war on drugs” in the region. Instead of their usual route, heading west toward Venezuela, fishers said they now head east, staying close to the coast of Trinidad. On Thursday, villagers told the Guardian that the fishers now don’t want to go out at all. Activist David Abdulah, speaking for the regional executive committee for the Assembly of Caribbean People, stood outside the US embassy in Port of Spain on Thursday declaring that the Caribbean must remain a “zone of peace”. Alluding to Washington’s history of interference in Haiti and Latin America, and its invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983, Abdulah warned that there was an imminent threat to the region’s sovereignty and peace. Launching a regional declaration condemning renewed US militarisation, he said: “The people of the Caribbean must stand firm against any attempt to drag us into war.” Juanita Goebertus Estrada, Americas director at Human Rights Watch said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions. “The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury. ”In the different recent strikes conducted in the Caribbean, the US authorities made no effort to minimize harm and have not sought to demonstrate that the individuals aboard vessels posed any imminent threat to life,” she said.",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/trump-caribbean-venezuela-trinidad-boat-strikes,World news,2025-10-17T15:46:35Z,12
world/2025/oct/16/church-of-norway-says-sorry-to-lgbtq-people-for-shame-great-harm-and-pain,"Church of Norway says sorry to LGBTQ+ people for ‘shame, great harm and pain’ ","Against a backdrop of red stage curtains at one of Oslo’s most prominent LGBTQ+ spaces, the Church of Norway apologised for the discrimination and harm it had inflicted. “The church in Norway has caused LGBTQ+ people shame, great harm and pain,” the presiding bishop, Olav Fykse Tveit, said on Thursday. “This should never have happened and that is why I apologise today.” The “discrimination, unequal treatment and harassment” had caused some to lose their faith, Tveit acknowledged. A church service at Oslo Cathedral was scheduled to follow his apology. The apology took place at the London Pub, one of two bars targeted in the 2022 shooting that killed two people and left nine seriously injured during Oslo’s Pride celebrations. A Norwegian of Iranian origin, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for the killings. Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church. In the 1950s, the church’s bishops described gay people as a “social danger of global proportions”. But as Norwegian society became increasingly liberal, becoming the second in the world to allow same-sex registered partnerships in 1993 and in 2009 the first Scandinavian country to allow same-sex marriage, the church slowly followed. In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able to marry in church since 2017. In 2023, Tveit participated in Oslo’s Pride parade in what was described as a first for the church. Thursday’s apology was met with a mixed reaction. The head of a network of Christian lesbians in Norway, Hanne Marie Pedersen-Eriksen, herself a gay pastor, described it as “an important reparation” and a moment that “finally marked the end of a dark chapter in the church’s history”. For Stephen Adom, the head of Norway’s Association for Gender and Sexual Diversity, the apology was “strong and important” but had come “too late for those among us who died of Aids … with hearts filled with anguish because the church considered the epidemic to be God’s punishment”. Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the Church of England apologised for what it described as its “shameful” treatment, though it continues to refuse to allow same-sex marriages in church. Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last year apologised for its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman. Earlier this year, the United Church of Canada offered an apology to two spirit and LGBTQIA+ communities, describing it as a reaffirmation of the church’s “commitment to radical hospitality and full inclusion” in all aspects of church life. “We have failed to celebrate and delight in all of your beautiful creation,” Rev Michael Blair, the general secretary of the church, said. “We have wounded people instead of seeking wholeness. We are sorry.” With contributions from Agence France-Presse and Reuters",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/church-of-norway-says-sorry-to-lgbtq-people-for-shame-great-harm-and-pain,World news,2025-10-16T17:42:30Z,11
world/2025/oct/14/miss-major-griffin-gracy,"Miss Major, trailblazing US trans rights activist and Stonewall veteran, dies aged 78","Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a trailblazer of the transgender rights movement, longtime community organizer and veteran of the Stonewall riots, died on Monday, her representatives announced. The acclaimed activist died at her home in Little Rock, Arkansas, surrounded by family, the House of gg (the final organization she founded and led) announced. She was 78, and the group’s statement did not give a cause of death. Miss Major was one of the US’s most celebrated trans rights pioneers and elders, at the forefront of the fight for trans rights for more than five decades. She spent her final years providing a sanctuary for trans and gender-nonconforming people in her conservative home state, while continuing to travel the country to rally for trans rights and meet with young trans people and other LGBTQ+ organizers. Miss Major, known by her first name, earned a reputation as an outspoken and fearless champion for the liberation of Black trans women, fighting for communities that have long suffered extreme discrimination and violence and have been neglected by the gay rights movement. She was considered a mother to trans women across the country, some of them prominent community organizers themselves. She told the Guardian in a 2023 interview that she stopped counting after taking on 20 daughters. Her mantra, “I’m still fucking here!”, captured the joy and humor she brought to her activism and became a rallying cry for the resiliency of Black trans people – a call to live long, full lives in a society that pushes to marginalize and erase the community. Miss Major was born in Chicago. Her parents, a postal service administrator and beauty shop manager, took her to her first drag show but did not support her when she identified with the performers. Her family sent her to psychiatric institutions as a teenager to “get the gay outta me”, and her mother burned her dresses, she recounted in her 2023 book, Miss Major Speaks, a series of conversations with the writer, Toshio Meronek. She went on to perform in Jewel Box Revue, a drag show in Chicago, helped by a mentor named Kitty who gave her a wig, did her makeup and taught her to embrace her identity. Forced out of college in Minnesota for being trans, she ended up in New York, where she survived by doing sex work. Some of her early activism was rooted in the networks of sex workers who worked together to keep themselves safe from police and violent clients, she told the Guardian in 2023. Miss Major recounted suffering repeated police violence, including on 28 June 1969, when the New York police department raided the Stonewall Inn in the West Village, the rare gay bar that she said did not shun trans people. She and others fought back, and Miss Major recalled being knocked unconscious and jailed. “The cops beat on you till you drop. Everybody that stood up to them went through that. It wasn’t pretty. It was a riot. We were fighting for our lives. It was so sad,” she said in the 2023 interview. The Stonewall protests launched Pride and were considered the birth of the contemporary gay rights movement, but the trans women of color involved in the demonstrations were cast aside by the mainstream activism that followed. “We fought for no reason. It’s a shame the way it turned out. We started the riots and what did we get? Nothing. Nothing,” she said, recalling that gay and lesbian leaders were “ashamed to be seen with us”. During a later stint in a New York prison, Miss Major became a mentee of Frank “Big Black” Smith, who had led a major prison uprising and taught her principles of organizing, and how “you can’t throw anybody under the bus”, a guidance that drove her later work, she recalled. In the 1980s, Miss Major formed the Angels of Care, a group of trans women who served as caretakers for gay men dying in the Aids epidemic, with efforts in California and New York. In San Francisco, she became an accomplished community leader, driving the city’s first mobile needle exchange van and running a drop-in center for trans sex workers, despite pushback from its affiliated Aids non-profit. Miss Major went on to lead the Transgender Gender-Variant &amp; Intersex Justice Project (TGIJP), a group that fights the abuse of trans people of color in prison and provides support during re-entry. Janetta Johnson, one of her adopted daughters, now leads the organization, which today is called the Miss Major Alexander L Lee TGIJP Black Trans Cultural Center. In recent years, Miss Major suffered repeated health challenges, yet she continued her work through the House of gg, which she also nicknamed Telling It Like It Fuckin’ Is (Tilifi). The organization brings trans leaders to her colorful Little Rock guest house, called the Oasis, to provide a refuge for rest and relaxation. “I’ve gotta make joy here, because it doesn’t exist in the normal world,” Miss Major said during a 2023 interview at her home. “They want us to live in the 1950s. No. Get off our fucking backs and let us live … I know the world I would like to live in. It’s in my head, but I try my best to live it now.” Miss Major is survived by Beck Witt, her longtime partner; her three sons, Asaiah, Christopher, and Jonathon; and her “many daughters”, House of gg said. “She was a world builder, a visionary, and unwavering in her devotion to making freedom possible for Black, trans, formerly and currently incarcerated people as well as the larger trans and LGB community. Because of her, countless new possibilities have been made for all of us to thrive – today and for generations to come,” the organization said in a post on Monday. “While her physical presence has shifted, we have gained an immensely powerful ancestor and there is no doubt that she is and always will be with us – guiding, protecting and reminding us that she is ‘still fucking here!’”",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/miss-major-griffin-gracy,World news,2025-10-14T18:29:05Z,9
commentisfree/2025/oct/25/black-history-month-panel-the-supremes-marcus-garvey-tupac-shakur-music-museums-film,"The Supremes, Marcus Garvey, Tupac Shakur: the cultural figures who inspired our Black History Month panel","Percival Everett showed me the transformative power of literature Lenny Henry Actor, writer and comedian and the author, with Marcus Ryder, of The Big Payback: The Case for Reparations for Slavery and How They Would Work Black culture is a dynamic force that continually reshapes my identity and worldview through its art. Two remarkable works that have profoundly influenced me are James and Wounded, both by the brilliant Percival Everett. I had the privilege of attending the Booker prize ceremony last year, where I was in the same room as Everett. Although he didn’t win for James, the reading by Nonso Anozie was both devastatingly moving and hilariously insightful. Everett is a masterful African-American author who captures the complexities of contemporary Black identity in the US. James is a literary remix of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, told from the perspective of Jim, the enslaved character. It’s a funny and thrilling exploration of racism, slavery and humanity’s capacity for cruelty. Everett’s retelling allows Jim and his fellow plantation workers to communicate in a way that transcends the often parodic depictions of Black speech. The line, “Dey takes the lies dey want and throws away the truth dat scares ’em”, reflects a deep wisdom. This novel reveals that compassion, humour and kindness can be found in the most unexpected places. The transformative power of literacy shines through when Jim realises, “If I could see the words, then no one could control them or what I got from them.” This message should be shared with every child at the start of Black History Month. I’m equally captivated by Wounded, set in Wyoming, where John, a Black horse trainer, assists a young man ostracised for his sexuality. The story navigates heavy themes of homophobia and love with grace and humour. It’s beautifully written, and I eagerly await its film adaptation, but read the book first! Percival Everett continues to be a literary hero for me, embodying the wisdom that “If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not learning.” Pan-Africanism awakened my fascination with history Zeinab Badawi Broadcaster, journalist and president of Soas University of London A defining thought for me was the doctrine of pan-Africanism. That really awakened my interest in history, because I really would like to see history as part of that pan-African drive to unite the people of Africa and also people of African descent. History not only explains our past, it also defines our present. You can’t reduce the experiences of people of African descent to one narrative but there are more unifying factors than ones that divide. The main one is that there is nowhere in Africa that didn’t experience foreign subjugation in one way or another. If anyone exemplified that thought for me, it was Gamal Abdel Nasser, of Egypt. I choose him because he is seen as an Arab leader and yet he was also very firmly anchored in the concept of pan-Africanism. He even arranged a marriage for Kwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister and president of Ghana, ensuring he had a wife from Egypt, in a spirit of pan-Africanism and unity of the people of the continent. A lot of people tend to hive off the north of Africa and say it is part of the Arab world and not part of Africa proper – and Nasser countered that view. As someone who was born in Sudan, very much at the crossroads of the Arab world and Africa – at least the northern part of Sudan where I am from – Nasser and Nkrumah helped shape my view of pan-Africanism. Winifred Atwell’s virtuosic musicianship was an early lesson in freedom YolanDa Brown Saxophonist, composer, broadcaster and chair of the British Phonographic Industry I recently unveiled the blue plaque to the pianist and composer Winifred Atwell, and hearing the joyful bounce of The Black and White Rag playing out in the street in front of where she lived brought it all back to life for me. I could feel the sparkle in her playing, precise yet playful, classical yet carefree. When I first heard her music, I was in my teenage years and completely intrigued. I learned that this vibrant sound came from a Trinidadian woman who had topped the UK charts in the 1950s, a broadcaster and entrepreneur too, opening one of the first Black hair salons in the UK. Atwell’s story speaks to possibility. A classically trained pianist who refused to be boxed in, she moved effortlessly between Chopin and boogie-woogie, and played everywhere from concert halls to variety shows. She was an elegant Black woman redefining what the piano and who a pianist could be. For me, Winifred Atwell’s music was an early lesson in freedom. She showed me that you could carry your heritage into any room and still fill it with your own voice. Her example whispered reassurance, as I began to carve my own path in music, blending jazz, reggae and soul … there’s space for all of it. Atwell played with joy that transcended boundaries. Watching old footage now, I see more than show-womanship – I see courage. She turned the piano into a meeting place of cultures, histories and hope. Through her, I learned that the most powerful statement you can make is to be unapologetically you. I strive to carry forward the flame of Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey Nadine White Journalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondent I first heard the name Marcus Garvey in the reggae songs my mum played throughout my childhood – roots tunes from Burning Spear and Culture booming through our small London flat. I remember thinking, “Who’s Marcus?” and being told stories about this great Jamaican man who taught pride and self-determination. I listened to my older brother, Sam, talk about his movement. Mum was a collector of Black art back in the day and bought a striking painting of Garvey that took pride of place in our living room. Within a Eurocentric society, that culturally Jamaican home was my haven … full of music, books and images that told me who I was and who I could be. I grew up literally watching Garvey. Later, I read Colin Grant’s biography of him, Negro With a Hat, and pored over Garvey’s speeches. Garvey was flawed like anyone, but his message – that we must organise, create and own our stories – shaped how I move through the world. His use of media as a tool for liberation still fuels me; when I asked the health secretary questions during a televised Covid press conference at Downing Street, it was the aforementioned portrait of Garvey that hung in the background of my home. When I make films or build platforms to amplify Black voices, I’m carrying that same flame. Garvey taught me that pride and purpose are not luxuries; they’re a responsibility. Marvin Gaye articulated my angst – and that of an entire generation Gus Casely-Hayford Cultural historian, broadcaster and lecturer, and the inaugural director of V&amp;A East I felt politics long before I understood what it was. Even as a very young child, I sensed something in the dignified rage of Muhammad Ali, I felt it in the defiance of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, the indefatigability of Arthur Ashe. Alongside their brilliance, I detected an epigenetic rage, something that felt old and raw and right – it electrified me, even as a child. And who could resist such exquisite, stately, controlled anger, channelled with forensic effect to offer deep, enduring, emotional and communal catharsis. My sister Margaret was, and remains, the most beautiful and inspiring person I have ever met, and on this particular afternoon she was looking the kind of cool that could have got her cast in an early Melvin Van Peebles movie. She was wearing a fawn suede waistcoat, a brown flowery shirt and her afro was fringed with the special sepia-tinted sunlight that warmed our south London living room on late summer afternoons. She walked over to the radiogram – and dropped the needle on a track. The sound was turned way up – there were two seismic crackles that could have been heard in Tooting Bec, and then Marvin Gaye began: “Mother, mother”, It was a ballad, a prayer, an ode, a love song to a generation, a political tractus, a lament to what was lost – but most profoundly, it was a song for the rest of us. Our planet, hope, compassion were dying – and those that cared were not being listened to. It articulated the angst of a generation, it asked for love, reason, rapprochement – but it also asked something of you: that you stand up. Tupac Shakur’s poetry inspired me to call out inequality Simone Orefuwa Vice-president of the National Black Police Association Music was a cornerstone of my upbringing – my father was a huge reggae and dancehall fan, always buying records. I’ve yet to meet anyone with as much vinyl as him! But when I discovered Yo! MTV Raps, I instantly knew I had found my genre. There was something powerful in the rhythmic storytelling, where words danced over beats. Rap music exposed me to the struggles of Black communities in the US and UK, where they spoke about poverty, racism, inequality, police brutality and broken families, while also rapping about resilience, hope and empowerment. The list of rappers I listen to is extensive, but for me, Tupac Shakur was a musical genius and my favourite poet. Many of his songs are social commentaries on injustice and compassion. Changes highlighted the systemic oppression, the mental toll this can take and the need for social reform. Soulja’s Story covered racism and police brutality experienced as a young Black man. Meanwhile, songs such as Keep Ya Head Up and Dear Mama showed empowerment for Black women while expressing vulnerability, tenderness and optimism. For me, rap was more than just the music, it was also about the fashion. I begged my parents for clothing from brands such as Karl Kani and Cross Colours. I loved the baggy jeans, oversized tops, trainers/Timberlands and bandanas. It gave me a confidence to celebrate my Black identity and showcase Black designers. As I continue to listen to Tupac’s lyrics, I’m struck by how powerful his words remain today as we face the rise of the far right and misogynistic behaviour. Tupac inspired me to use my voice to challenge and call out inequality: something I’m proud to do now through my work with the National Black Police Association. The Hip-Hop Preacher taught me the true value of hard work Michael Akadiri Doctor and standup comedian I’ve long found “Monday motivation” – the posting of motivational quotes on Monday mornings – quite insipid. I understand the rationale; few are bullish about work on a Monday especially after a decompressing weekend. However, I’ve always queried the benefit a motivational quote will have if that desire doesn’t come from within. That’s until I came across American motivational speaker Eric Thomas, AKA The Hip Hop Preacher, and his famous mantra “when you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful” a few years ago. A friend had shared a short clip of Thomas delivering this potent line and I suspect it was the forceful delivery, the pure emphasis on “breathe” that struck a chord with me. My medical background is perhaps the reason for this but, of course, you don’t need a medical degree to know breathing is essential for life. Immediately the internal interrogation began: am I pursuing my career goals with the sheer intensity that they’re essential for life? Am I leaving no stone unturned? Or am I cruising on talent and a bit of effort and hoping divine intervention will make up the shortfall? If I’m honest, it’s probably the latter. Yet my inner cynicism tried to rear its ugly head: “Technically, breathing is involuntary.” A deflection attempt made in vain. Deep down, I knew Eric was right. Being obsessive and determined have underpinned my successes to date. Thomas’s quote was a timely reminder that if I want to continue succeeding – within medicine, comedy or even both – I need to perceive accomplishments as being as essential as oxygen is to staying alive. The confidence and conviction of Mia Mottley showed me true leadership Shana Maloney Priest in charge of St James church, Clapton, east London I grew up in Barbados with Mia Mottley as the most prominent female in the political and public life of Barbados – as the opposition leader – a familiar voice that carried across the island. You didn’t just hear her; you felt her influence in the way people spoke about possibility and in how young people, especially girls, looked to follow in her footsteps. Even as a child, I recognised and was drawn to her confidence and conviction – her belief that people could and should reach further. In some part of my young mind, I would tell people: “If Mia is opposition leader, then I will be the first female prime minister of Barbados.” Mia Amor Mottley is a barrister and politician who has served as the prime minister of Barbados since 2018 – the first woman ever to hold that office. She previously served as minister of education, attorney general and deputy prime minister, leading with intellect and a striking sense of purpose. Under her leadership, Barbados became a republic in 2021, marking a defining moment of transformation within the Caribbean. Like her, and possibly because of her, I studied law – drawn by the same pursuit of justice and service for others. My path later led to the priesthood, but both vocations and her example have taught me that leadership is about service and the flourishing of people. Though we don’t share the same political views, I deeply respect her clarity of thought, courageand commitment. Mia Mottley embodies leadership rooted in intellect, responsibility and compassion. The Supremes sparked my diva worship Jason Okundaye Assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian There’s a phenomenon among gay men called “diva worship” that is our veneration of female singers whose artistic style, lyrics, dancing and beautiful voices trigger a latent flamboyance or accentuate it. Over the years this figure in my life has taken many forms – Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga, Whitney Houston. But the first divas I worshipped were the Supremes who, as a child, gifted me with a language through which to parse love and heartbreak well before I would come to know what position those emotions would have in my life. My favourite of the classics had always been their 1966 hit You Keep Me Hangin’ On – my childhood self, who would skip around the house singing it, couldn’t have known that it would become my go-to song whenever I wanted to be “set free” by yet another situationship who was sending me mixed signals or giving me hot-and-cold treatment. Then there was Baby Love and Stop! In the Name of Love (you can imagine me in front of the telly, left hand on hip, right hand in the air palm spread). But I loved the deep cuts too, from the sentimental to the smitten, which would prepare me for the pleasures and disappointments of love: Time Changes Things, It’s All Been Said Before, He’s All I Got. Buttered Popcorn, which allowed Florence Ballard to lead and showcase her commanding, soulful timbre (sadly when I tried buttered popcorn I was disgusted by it, though it spoke to my experience with greasy, sticky, salty men). I have no musical talent, but I think the Supremes were pretty formative to how I would come to approach prose – being sincere with emotion and feeling, and the stakes when you expose yourself to being bruised. So thanks for guiding my pen, and carrying me through heartbreak. The Black Panther soundtrack pushed me to make consequential work Athena Kugblenu Comedian and writer If you’re not fanatical about the soundtrack to Eddie Murphy’s movie The Nutty Professor, you must think Foxy Brown is a shade from Farrow and Ball. So what if the soundtrack had almost nothing to do with the film? It had everything to do with the tastes of the people who might watch actually the film. I didn’t mind that. That was its genius to me. Some 22 years later, watching the movie Black Panther changed my mind. Its final moments carry a powerful message of pan-Africanism that redeem Killmonger, the anti-hero. The revolution he wanted could be instigated by Wakanda after all. As the credits roll, this mesmerising notion is followed by All the Stars by Kendrick Lamar and SZA. I realised this soundtrack has everything to do with the film, and a lot to say. All the Stars is about the responsibility that comes with love and the consequences of achieving your dreams, a commentary on T’Challa’s story in the movie. The entire soundtrack is a conversation between Africa and the African diaspora, as is the film, layering trap, rap and R&amp;B with South African artistry, reflecting where many of the film’s cultural references were drawn from. It can be adored by anyone who listens but demands intellect to truly understand. The biggest film franchise in the world made an album with one of the biggest artists in the world that rewards us for paying attention. Now, as then, in these “swipe early, swipe often” times, I find something deeply refreshing about this. This soundtrack is a reminder to me to make consequential work. Plus, it never reneges on its one requirement: the songs still have to slap. On the soundtrack to Black Panther, they do. My 25-year career in the NHS all started with reggae Paulette Hamilton Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington Growing up in Handsworth, Birmingham, with very little, we were grateful for what we had. While we couldn’t afford the games other kids had, we had music and dance – not just any music, but reggae. This music did more than entertain us; it shaped the person I am today. I will always remember hearing Gregory Isaacs’s Night Nurse for the first time. That smooth, comforting rhythm drifted from my father’s radio and, years later, from my husband Dennis’s sound system as he DJ’d in our home. There was something truly transformative about that song. There are multiple interpretations of it, but to my mind, Isaacs sang of care, compassion, and being there for someone in their time of need, concepts that resonated deeply with my young mind. For me, a Black British woman, reggae was a cultural anchor. It connected me to my Jamaican heritage while giving me strength to face life’s challenges in Britain. When teachers dismissed children such as me, suggesting we were “only destined to have babies,” this music reinforced my sense of worth and ambition. Night Nurse became more than a song; it became a calling. Its lyrics about watching over someone and offering comfort and relief shaped the kind of nurse I aspired to be. It was the inspiration for my 25-year career in the NHS. Today, the music remains a powerful companion. It reminds me that from Birmingham to parliament, I’ve always been guided by one principle: true service means being present for those who need us, just like the night nurse in Isaacs’s timeless song. Seeing patois respected on the page transformed my TV reporting style Symeon Brown Reporter and journalist at Channel 4 News In college I was one of those boring boys who refused to read fiction. I learned the error of my ways when a good friend suggested that I pick up Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. If that book enlightened me to the human revelations that only fiction can deliver, it would be Sam Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners that changed me. The 1956 novel about the Windrush arrivals is a reflection of its characters: laid back, mischievous and the depth broods beneath the surface. It was the first time I saw patois respected on the page – the dialect is a forefather of my own multicultural London English. The connection has stayed with me even as a television news reporter. In a field that defers authority to softened received pronunciation my own cadence remains instantly recognisable and different. The Lonely Londoners is quintessentially a story about the original mandem too. Moses, Galahad and the boys were gyalis, hustlers and black aspirants in a racially hostile Britain. As the Windrush generation have been upgraded to “good immigrants” who “helped the mother country”, the balance provided in The Lonely Londoners and its nonfiction heir Journey to an illusion by Donald Hinds in 1966 constantly remind me that the good, the bad and the ugly of our stories must be told too. Finding The Lonely Londoners set off a bomb in me. The novel is a cornerstone of a black British canon that is far too invisible to black Britons themselves. It led me first to work in the Black Cultural Archives and then as a gatherer of black British stories as a news correspondent. If there is one urgency for Black History Month it must be to remember our forgotten canon. Read them. Watch them. Share them. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

world/2025/nov/08/guyana-azruddin-nazar-mohamed-arrested-us-extradition,Guyana in turmoil after opposition leader arrested and faces US extradition,"Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power. Azruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government. Facing 11 charges in a Florida court – including money laundering, bribery and tax evasion – they were released later the same day after posting bail of 150,000 Guyanese dollars each (about £547 or $719.95), but must report to the court weekly and will face a new hearing on Monday. Mohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media. Mohabir Anil Nandlall, Guyana’s attorney general, said the case was a “legal obligation” arising from the country’s international commitments – a 1931 extradition treaty between the UK and the US remains in force in Guyana, which became independent from Britain in 1966. The case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita. “It’s a situation where the status quo in Guyana is being challenged,” said Peter Wickham, a political scientist and director of a polling company in the Caribbean. Mohamed founded a party and announced his candidacy just three months before the presidential election, breaking with the country’s long-standing two-party system that has traditionally pitted the president’s PPP/C, broadly backed by the Indo-Guyanese population, against the APNU, generally supported by Afro-Guyanese voters. Mohamed urged Guyanese to reject “tribal voting” and, running on a populist, anti-establishment platform, promised to push for renegotiation of the oil deal – despite the country’s newly discovered oil wealth, more than half of its population still lives in poverty. “He hoped to become a kind of balance of power for whoever won the election, but the result ended up being better than he expected,” Wickham said. The incumbent Ali won, and his party secured 36 of the 65 seats in congress. But unlike in previous elections, it was not the APNU that emerged as the main opposition force – it won only 12 seats – but Mohamed’s party, with 16. Last Monday, three days after Mohamed was arrested and released on bail, he was sworn in alongside the rest of the new congress. He arrived in the Lamborghini at the centre of an alleged mail fraud case against him, in which he is accused of submitting a false $75,300 invoice for a vehicle said to have cost $680,000. Although the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024. In June 2024, a shipment containing about $5.3m in gold bars sent from Guyana by Mohamed’s Enterprise was seized at Miami international airport. That same month, the Mohameds were sanctioned by the US Department of Treasury on charges of gold smuggling, evading more than $50m in taxes owed to the Guyanese government and bribing local public officials. At a press conference last week, vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo – who led the country between 1999 and 2011 – said the extradition request came from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. “You see his signature there? ‘Marco Rubio,’” he said. “It’s not a junior man in Florida … that’s the seriousness [of it] … We are part of a treaty. We are part of an international community that believes people must pay for their crimes,” said Jagdeo. Mohamed and his lawyers declined to comment to the Guardian, but have previously denied wrongdoing. In addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition. The lawyers said they intend to challenge the case at every level, including the constitutional court and, ultimately, the Caribbean court of justice. Wickham said the case is likely to drag on. “While it goes on, he [Mohamed] remains a member of parliament … and I think he will continue to make life as difficult as he can for the government in his role as opposition leader,” he said.",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/08/guyana-azruddin-nazar-mohamed-arrested-us-extradition,World news,2025-11-08T13:00:04Z,7
commentisfree/2025/oct/20/spirituality-helps-make-sense-of-icomprehensible-world,"Spirituality isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice that helps make sense of an incomprehensible world","When I was leaving London for Melbourne, my eldest sister-in-law told her kids not to forget the “tradition” – to throw a bowl of water behind me as I stepped out the door. Just a small splash on the ground, a gesture older than borders. “La har azaab po aman se,” she whispered in Pashto under her breath – may all hardship stay away from you. The little ones giggled and waved their goodbyes as they spilled the water, somewhere between shy and amused. My mother used to do this too, back in Afghanistan. Every time I left for a journey, especially international ones, she’d quietly follow me to the gate with a bowl of water, whispering prayers I couldn’t always hear. But this moment, between two western cities, with children growing up in a world so far from where that habit began, felt different. It was softer. Bittersweet. Like watching an old song being hummed in a new language. I grew up between Kabul and Karachi; two cities that always felt like they were on the edge of something. One broken by war, the other always just holding itself together amid all sorts of hardships of a city outgrowing itself but starved of resources and infrastructure. In both, I learned that people survive not just through faith but through the small things they do when no one’s watching; the quiet rituals and little beliefs that live in everyday life. They’re not loud, not official. But they’re full of love and hope. I saw it all around me. In the way my grandmother would suggest a black cloth by the door after someone recovered from illness or we bought something “precious” – to keep the evil eye away. In the way my aunt would burn esfand herb above her children in a pot when they came home from a wedding or party looking too beautiful and getting too much attention. In the way my other sister-in-law would put a tiny black dot behind her baby’s ear when he smiled too much – just to hide some of that beauty from the world. “People are not very nice and too much goodness invites jealousy and negativity,” she’d say. “It’s better to be a little hidden.” Drawing on my own encounters, I’ve come to see how these seemingly small gestures – the fragrant smoke of esfand to lift heaviness, the rhythmic pull of qawwali, the quiet assurance of a taweez tied around a wrist – hold more than superstition. They carry virtues: grounding, comfort and a deep sense of protection. None of these things were in any book of religion. No one ever sat down and taught them. They were just picked up, like pebbles from the ground, passed from women to girls, from grandmothers to mothers to daughters – and sometimes to sons who were paying attention. Even the most religious people I know – people who prayed five times a day, who fasted every Ramadan, who could quote the Qur’an by heart – still do these little things. They didn’t see them as separate or wrong. Just part of faith and tradition woven together into everyday life, to feel safe and at peace. When I moved to Melbourne, I carried some of those things with me. Not in boxes but in habits. I still whisper Ayatul Kursi before a flight, even if I’m late and running through the airport. I still avoid sweeping the house at night, not because I’m scared but because I remember my mother saying, “You’ll sweep away your blessings”. Sometimes I think these little rituals stayed with me more than the big teachings. Not because they were more important but because they were more personal. More human. They helped us make sense of a world that often didn’t make sense. Especially back home where things could change overnight, where life was unpredictable, where people had lost so much. And they remind me that spirituality itself isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice, woven into daily life. It takes on local colours while pointing to something universal. I’ve seen echoes of it elsewhere in the chanting circles of Indigenous Australians, where voices rise together in rhythm and prayer; in the protective rituals of other communities, each finding its own way of asking for peace. Across cultures, people reach for these small, invisible shields. I still remember the trees outside a mosque in the bazaar of Kabul. People used to tie little strips of cloth to its branches; one for each prayer they made. Because these rituals are more than just old habits. They are threads that connect us to our past, whispers of love carried across generations and subtle ways of finding peace in a world that so often feels chaotic. Maybe one day, they will fade. Maybe the children who threw water behind me in London won’t pass the tradition on to their own kids. But as long as we live, humans will search for these quiet, innocent acts of hope and protection gestures that don’t always make sense on paper but make all the difference in the heart. • Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and Australia",social,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/20/spirituality-helps-make-sense-of-icomprehensible-world,Opinion,2025-10-19T14:00:17Z,7
world/2025/nov/06/mumbai-slum-dwellers-dharavi-adani-group-redevelopment-plan-bulldozers-india,"Threats, fear and hope as Mumbai slum dwellers await the bulldozers","For months, the threatening phone calls kept coming. First, allegedly from an ex-police officer and a retired army general, and then from the police themselves. Finally, Mohammad Khurshid Shaikh claims, he was summoned to the police station and told clearly: keep quiet or there will be real trouble for you. Shaikh is among those fighting a multimillion-dollar project in which Dharavi – one of India’s largest and most storied slums – will be bulldozed and redeveloped by the multinational conglomerate Adani Group. “The culture and ecosystem of Dharavi is like nowhere else in the world,” says Shaikh. “But they want to destroy our community and stop us speaking out.” The dank gullies of Dharavi sit in stark contrast to the soaring skyscrapers and Bollywood penthouses that loom over the settlement. Homes are built haphazardly and often without proper sanitation, unregulated industries emit toxic smoke and the air is filled with the suffocating smell of open sewers. To some, the promise of Dharavi transformed into a glistening neighbourhood of luxury high-rises, neat parks, shiny shopping centres and homes with two toilets is an aspirational dream come true. “We don’t have proper healthcare, roads or drainage and there’s nowhere for children to play,” says A Selvin Nadar, 56, a chai seller who migrated from Tamil Nadu in 1982. “The only way is to tear it all down and build us new homes.” But others, such as Shaikh, are resisting. None deny that Dharavi, long neglected as an illegal encroachment, is in stark need of investment and development. Yet they fear that this plan – absent of public consultation – is one that will turn a piece of prime Mumbai real estate into a playground for the rich, forcing out the lower-caste, migrant communities who have been there since the late 1800s. It was these shunned, displaced people who built up the empty marshland into a widely studied marvel of self-reliance and economic productivity, whose output is valued at between $1bn and $2bn a year, making it one of the world’s largest informal economies. Of the roughly 1 million residents living in the dense 220-hectare (2.2 sq km) area, fewer than half will be eligible for new homes in the development, which is projected to take seven years to complete. Others will be moved to wastelands and salt plains on the far outskirts of the city, threatening to fragment a generations-old community. Some will not get homes at all. Those allowed to remain in Dharavi will be given apartments in tower blocks, a significant rupture from the organic, communal way of living and working that has sustained Dharavi for so long. Industries from tailoring to pottery and recycling are likely to shrink in number and be moved to a designated “commercial zone” far from people’s residences. For those such as Shaikh, a leather artisan and third generation of his family to live in Dharavi, the plan presents an existential threat. His rickety, three-storey workshop makes leather coats – sharp blazers, suede trenches, studded bomber jackets – sold in high-end shops in south Mumbai and abroad. His family lives in the rooms below and his workers and tailors – migrants from north India – also sleep there, enabling him to afford their labour. Outside Dharavi’s enclave, Mumbai rents are often 10 times as high for a single room. Harassment and intimidation In the government offices nearby, an illustrated mock-up of the Dharavi project depicts a very different vision for the future. Slickly dressed residents mill about on bicycles and e-vehicles, buying western-style baguettes and croissants and having coffee on a terrace outside Dharavi Cafe and Ice-Cream. It is a world away from the 20-rupee (18p) idli sambar breakfast and 5-rupee chai (3p) that sustains Dharavi’s community. “This is not development for us,” says Shaikh. “It’s a massive real estate deal that will make it unaffordable for us to survive.” There is also distrust of the Adani Group. Run by Gautam Adani – one of India’s most powerful tycoons and a close ally of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi – the conglomerate has faced accusations of crony capitalism and financial impropriety, which it denies. While the state government calls it a joint project, Adani Group paid $950m for its 80% stake. A case alleging that the project was unfairly awarded to Adani is being considered in India’s supreme court. Since they began to vocally oppose the development, Shaikh and other residents claim they have been subjected to a long-running campaign of harassment and intimidation – including phone calls, direct threats and suggestions that speaking against the project was to speak against the country – by figures they allege work for Adani Group. Among those accused of issuing the threats is Vilas Gangawane, a retired police officer. Gangawane confirmed to the Guardian he was working as an intelligence officer for Adani Group in Dharavi but denied any threats or coercion and said those who made the allegations had “malicious intentions”. A spokesperson for Navbharat Mega Developers Private Limited, the Adani-government entity handling Dharavi, said all accusations of intimidation and harassment were “unfounded” and that their survey had been done “with complete fairness and transparency”. The project, they added, had received “enthusiastic support from the local community” and was under close supervision of the state government. “It is unfortunate that a small section with vested interests is spreading a false narrative to discredit the project and its officials,” the spokesperson said. Among residents, many illiterate and from the lowest strata of society, fears of displacement remain rife. Only those who can prove they were ground-floor residents before 1 January 2000 are eligible for a house in the new development. One of the documents required to prove residency is an electricity bill – but Dharavi only got full electricity coverage in 2008. Though homes and workshops are scheduled for demolition within the next two months, the final masterplan for the development has still not been made public. Jitender Jathwa, 48, is among 5,000 clay artisans working in Dharavi, where he is part of an efficient ecosystem built over four generations; the potters live next to their workshops and the pottery market. “They are heartless to the survival of our craft,” says Jathwa. “How will I work if we are moved far away from our workshops? And even if I get a house in a shiny tower, how could I afford to maintain a place like that? Eventually I would be forced out.” Mahendra Kalyankar, the government chief executive of the Dharavi project, denied that the development would ostracise and fragment the community and said he had not heard of residents facing pressure. “A dignified house is a necessity for everyone,” says Kalyankar. “Everything has been minutely planned and taken into consideration. Dharavi can become a central business district if developed properly and it will be a paradise on earth for residents. Once we start the work, there will be no issues of trust.” Kalyankar said the terms of rehabilitation for Dharavi residents were “much more generous” than other slum projects in Mumbai. Those who can prove they were residents between 2000 and 2011 will be moved to other designated sites and given new homes for 250,000 rupees (£2,200), still a significant sum for many. Yet these sites are miles away from Dharavi and include Deonar, which has been a waste-dumping ground for decades. Officials said the site was being decommissioned but, when the Guardian visited, dozens of rubbish trucks were still dumping large quantities of Mumbai’s waste. The air was also heavily polluted, the result of methane fires at the dump and emissions from a nearby energy plant that burns rubbish. Residents around Deonar said they were experiencing chronic health problems caused by the toxic air, a situation they described as devastating for their children. “Why would they bring people from Dharavi here, it is not safe even to breathe,” says Jamal Ud Din, 39, a shoemaker whose house abuts the waste ground. “They will be moving them into hell.” • This article was amended on 6 November 2025.

commentisfree/2025/oct/26/trump-white-house-far-right-populism,Trump’s megalomaniac White House project fits a global trend among far-right populists,"Amid all the horrors of the second Trump administration, the demolition of the East Wing is hardly in the top 10. But it provides a powerful symbol of wanton destruction – and, as Trump himself knows full well, images matter greatly in politics. It also curiously combines so many elements of a distinctly Trumpian approach to government: shameless falsehoods about the proposed ballroom (“It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it but not touching it”); complete disregard for legislation (in this case rules about preservation), and unprecedented levels of cronyism (with CEOs trying to curry favor with the president through donations to a grotesque project of self-aggrandizement). There is also something very poignant about the destruction of an edifice which had provided an office of one’s own for first ladies. For all these peculiarities, Trump’s disfiguring the White House fits into a larger global trend: far-right populist leaders in many countries have used spectacular architecture to advance their political agenda and, more particularly, to set their vision of a “real people” – as in “real Americans”, “real Hungarians” et cetera – in stone. Just before Christmas 2020, in the dying days of his first administration, Trump had already taken time off from his busy schedule promoting the big lie about having won the election in order to issue an executive order entitled “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture”. The order made “classicism” the preferred style for new federal buildings, stopping just short of banning modernism entirely. Biden rescinded the order; Trump brought a version of it back right on inauguration day this year. What is almost entirely forgotten is that the 2020 order had belonged together with Trump’s “1776 commission”, the ill-fated attempt to whitewash US history; both the architecture orders and the instructions for history teaching were meant to promote an image of the US as pure and “beautiful”. In his use of the built environment, Trump is less an example of American exceptionalism than is suggested by credulous accounts of “Trump, ever the developer.” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has had massive structures erected, from a gigantic mosque in Istanbul to a new presidential palace in Ankara; he has also promoted the Ottoman-Seljuk style as reflecting his neo-Ottoman understanding of Turkey. Viktor Orbán’s reconstructions of historical edifices on Budapest’s Castle Hill are supposed to present a correct understanding of Hungarian history; India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been reconstructing Hindu temples – most controversially on the ruins of the destroyed mosque in Ayodhya. The pattern is usually this: one layer of history – be it the Mughal period or, in Hungary, state socialism with its modernist buildings – is removed and a reconstruction is celebrated as a return to a people’s authenticity and greatness. But beyond this symbolic message about “the real people”, large construction projects demonstrate dominance; the implicit claim is: “We won and now the country is ours!” And that claim is inevitably in citizens’ faces: one might avoid all kinds of propaganda online and on TV, but one cannot avoid buildings in everyday life. Even if such autocratic figures were removed from office – and of course they do everything to avoid that outcome – their edifices and monuments will remain. True, in one sense Trump’s case is unique: he already had a portfolio of buildings before assuming office – though most of his own buildings had never been particularly classical; instead, they are modern on the outside, while on the inside one finds a nouveau riche fever fantasy of Versailles – which has now also spawned an engoldened Oval Office, displaying what an astute critic, Kate Wagner, has called “regional car dealership rococo”. And while size matters for all far-right leaders on one level (just think of Erdoğan’s enormous palace in Ankara), hardly anybody else would have fixated on a ballroom. Perhaps the reason is as banal as the fact that banquets and catering were one of the few business ventures in which Trump ever had genuine success; more likely, it is a space for unlimited adulation of the president and for plenty of occasions for “deal-making”. Architects promoting traditional styles have been happy to go along with Trump’s ideas. To be sure, style is never just reducible to a particular politics; modernism is not automatically progressive (some fascist edifices in Italy are modernist marvels). But the way some promoters of classicism have talked about “beauty” and insisted that “classical public buildings make us feel proud of our country” is not only backward-looking; it easily legitimizes a Magalomaniac architecture of little aesthetic value. The architect in charge of the ballroom, James C McCrery II, trained with, and worked for, Eisenman, one of the great proponents of the “deconstructivism” in architecture that one of Trump’s executive orders explicitly derided for its “disorder”. McCrery came to regard non-traditional architecture as “ungodly” and started to specialize in church architecture. Eisenman in turn has called the ballroom plans “bonkers” and observed that “putting a portico at the end of a long facade and not in the center is what one might say is untutored”. This monstrosity might well be empty most of the time (unless it can be re-purposed to store classified documents). It is not too early to think about how it could either be modified or perhaps removed altogether. Of course, the Maga activists who opposed every removal of a Confederate statue in the name of “preserving history” would not be happy. But then again, they had nothing to say about the destruction of the East Wing – a building of which citizens who have visited the White House are likely to have fond memories.

commentisfree/2025/oct/22/donald-trump-us-democracy-white-house-east-wing,Big? Beautiful? Donald Trump is literally ripping apart the home of US democracy. Is anyone really surprised?,"Occasionally, life gives you scenarios that are so on the money it’s impossible to do anything with them. Boris Johnson getting stuck halfway down a zip wire while waving two union flags, for instance; or Liz Truss getting lost while attempting to leave a room – two images that are so embarrassingly on point it is almost difficult to enjoy them. An audience likes to feel it has done a bit of work before arriving at a punch line, which is why, on Monday, when demolition crews moved into the White House to knock down part of the East Wing at the behest of Donald Trump, it felt once again like we were living in post-satirical times. As far as we can tell from the photos, Trump didn’t actually send in a wrecking ball – although his administration did sharply reprimand government employees working in a neighbouring Treasury building for posting visuals of the demolition online, so at this point who knows? There were, however, diggers, torn-down walls and an awful lot of dust. This was the first stage of a project Trump has advertised as the addition to the White House of a 90,000 sq ft (8,300 sq metres) ballroom, at an estimated cost of $250m (£187m) and a capacity, according to Trump, of “999 people”. And while, granted, it’s not a branch of McDonald’s – one thing about Trump’s range is that, however bad things are, they could always have been worse – architectural and heritage institutes have been expressing concern. Presidents, of course, like to leave their mark on the nation’s furnishings as on its finances. The Obamas planted a kitchen garden at the White House, put in a basketball court and tweaked the lighting, apparently so it was bright enough for their daughters to do their homework. Joe Biden had less time to renovate, but did swap out Trump’s gold drapes in the Oval Office for some sober Clinton-era curtains and a new rug. Trump, meanwhile, paved over the Rose Garden, decked out the Oval Office in gold, and now appears to be wholesale demolishing the East Wing’s 1942 facade to build a giant event space – and you have to wonder if the state banquet he enjoyed at Windsor Castle last month has been a spur to get construction under way. As for what the new space might look like, we must assume that Clark Construction and McCrery Architects, the design and building entities involved, will be led by Trump’s general aesthetic and find a happy medium between the Grand Ballroom at Mar-a-Lago and Saddam Hussein’s palace. Well, you can imagine, there’s been some carping online. The Society of Architectural Historians released a statement expressing “great concern” over the proposed ballroom. The American Institute of Architects put out a stiff note reminding the president that “the historic edifice at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is the People’s House, a national treasure and an enduring symbol of our democracy”. And more importantly, that “any modifications to it – especially modifications of this magnitude – should reflect the importance, scale and symbolic weight of the White House itself”. This was, perhaps, a discreet way of pointing out that, given you can barely put up a shelf in a major city on the eastern seaboard without having to get a permit, the DC Department of Buildings might care to look into things. In her commentary online, Hillary Clinton was more direct: “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.” For many Americans, the demolition photos were soul-shuddering in a way that has no direct equivalence in the UK. I suppose if they changed the door numbers in Downing Street a lot of people might be upset and disturbed. But the building at No 10, and the living quarters in particular – which for a long time looked like one of those rental ads that go viral for demanding £2,000 a month for a flat in east London that is smaller than the inside of a canal boat – have never been as iconic or emotionally charged as their US counterparts. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, dismissed all the chatter as “fake outrage”, while the president himself posted online, “For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc.” As with everything Trump says, it’s the “etc” in this sentence that should cause the most worry. The ballroom will be funded via private donations, setting up yet another race to curry favour with the president. And, as an event space, it will run in competition with the Trump International Hotel, offering the possibility of a very Trumpian future use for the building: the White House as venue for corporate retreat.

commentisfree/2025/oct/25/why-is-trump-demolishing-the-white-houses-east-wing-because-he-wants-to,Why is Trump demolishing the White House’s East Wing? Because he wants to,"Donald Trump has quite the passion for American history. If there’s a controversial statue commemorating a dead white supremacist out there, there’s a good chance the president has gone to bat for it. “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” Trump tweeted in 2017, in response to a push to remove Confederate monuments. “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson – who’s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!” Trump added. Trump is right that you can’t change history. But, if you’re the president, you can abruptly bulldoze it with no permits and no public input. The 123-year-old East Wing of the White House, the home of offices for every first lady for almost half a century, is now a pile of rubble. After Trump said in July that the historic building would not be touched, it was stealthily bulldozed to make way for a $300m ballroom. According to Trump, there was a teeny little change of plans “after really a tremendous amount of study with some of the best architects in the world”. Speaking of plans, the bulldozing went ahead without any such thing being submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government building. But don’t worry, according to the White House, construction plans will be coming soon. Watch this space! While the likes of the National Trust for Historic Preservation are upset about the destruction of a “National Historic Landmark, a National Park, and a globally recognized symbol of our nation’s ideals”, some large corporations appear to be looking on the bright side. Trump has said the new 90,000 sq ft ballroom is going to be “paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”. Now the world’s CEOs have a wonderful opportunity to prove just how friendly to Trump they are. A list of donors including Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google have already lined up to contribute to the project. Defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and Palantir – who seem to know a thing or two about reducing beloved buildings to rubble – are also reportedly funding the project. If this sort of thing were happening in a developing country it might smack of corruption. But this is the United States, so it’s obviously all above board. National history aside, this sudden demolition of the first ladies’ headquarters raises a lot of questions. If I lived in a house that I didn’t own – one that I was scheduled to move out of in January 2029 – I probably wouldn’t start an enormous and extremely controversial construction project. Why is Trump doing this? The short answer is: because he wants to. As I think we all know by now, the president does whatever the hell he feels like regardless of norms, conventions or silly little laws. And, increasingly, there’s nobody there to stop him. The only checks that Trump cares about are the ones made out to him and the only balances he is interested in are those of his bank accounts. Trump has given a few rationales for the project that go beyond “because I want to”. He’s argued that the old East Wing was no longer fit for purpose and a much larger space was needed. There are some people out there who agree with him. Gahl Hodges Burt, for example, who was social secretary for three years under Ronald Reagan, told the New York Times that tearing down the East Wing to make space for the ballroom was unfortunately necessary and overdue. Beyond practical issues, there’s also ego. Trump’s big-boy ballroom will be a big shiny monument to him long after he’s gone. Still, you’ve got to wonder whether this mega-project means the president is not actually planning on going anywhere anytime soon. Particularly since Trump doesn’t seem to be the sort of person to start a large project he won’t have a chance to personally enjoy. The US constitution’s 22nd amendment makes it very clear that a president cannot have more than two terms. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeatedly teasing the idea that he might serve a third term. In March, he told NBC News he was “not joking” about the idea and that there were methods for doing so. Trump’s army of sycophants certainly seem to be exploring these methods. Earlier this year, the Tennessee Republican representative Andy Ogles proposed amending the constitution to allow Trump to serve three terms. And this week, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, Steven Bannon, told the Economist that the president will “get a third term”. Bannon said that there’s “a plan” to deal with the 22nd amendment and “at the appropriate time” they’ll lay out the plan. It may seem unthinkable that Trump could seek to serve a third term. To quote the president again, however: “You can’t change history, but you can learn from it.” And if there is one lesson to be learned from Maga history, it’s that you should never underestimate Trump or overestimate the institutions that are supposed to keep his megalomania in check. The president will do anything he thinks he can get away with. Google drops a key career resource program for women in tech “The message it sends to women in tech, and really women in general, is that we cannot count on unwavering support from big corporations,” one tech worker told CNN. “We need to keep speaking up until we are heard. Google helped to do that, and they decided to quietly turn their back on us.” Google can’t be wasting time thinking about equality for women – it’s got Trump’s ballroom to fund!

Takaichi cites Margaret Thatcher as an influence and appointed just two women to her 19-member cabinet. She opposes same-sex marriage and is against changes to succession laws that would allow female members of the imperial household to become reigning empresses. Foreign journalists are still not allowed in Gaza The Foreign Press Association (FPA) has said it is disappointed in the Israeli supreme court’s decision to grant the state of Israel another delay regarding the independent entry of journalists into Gaza. It’s a shame that more journalists in the western media aren’t screaming at the top of their lungs about the murders of their colleagues in Gaza and this assault on press freedom – not to mention the fact that Israel is still not allowing adequate aid into Gaza. At the very least, the western media should be asking what it is that Israel doesn’t want reporters to see. Evidence of torture, perhaps? Settlers nearly club a Palestinian woman to death The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs recorded 71 incidents of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and their property in the occupied West Bank across just one week.

commentisfree/2025/nov/08/workplace-feminized-office-wokeness,Everybody panic – the workplace has become too ‘feminized’!,"Lean in (to misogyny), ladies! Are you a woman? Do you want to rapidly raise your profile and get booked on the speaking circuit? Are you good at mental gymnastics? If you answered yes to all of the above then gender grifting may be for you! This often-lucrative career path involves explaining to less enlightened women why feminism has gone too far and the world is much better off being run by men. You get extra points if you aren’t white, and can explain to the masses how racism is good, actually. You can see this hustle in the tradwife content all over social media. As Jameela Jamil recently noted, all the “tradwives” preaching to young women about how they should be submissive little ladies are massive hypocrites. They’re all making money, building their brands and securing their independence while telling other women they shouldn’t be doing the same. You can also, of course, see gender grifting on the likes of Fox News, where ambitious, albeit identikit, female anchors tut-tut on TV about how #MeToo has gone too far. And now, because the right has been so successful in rewriting reality, you can see gender grifting splashed all over the homepage of the New York Times. On Thursday, the Times published a transcript of a recent episode of the conservative columnist Ross Douthat’s podcast Interesting Times. This very interesting (in the British sense) piece was originally titled: Did Women Ruin the Workplace? The headline was then changed to the more nuanced: Did Liberal Feminism Ruin the Workplace? Douthat generously invites two women into his own workplace: the podcast features two critics of liberal feminism, Helen Andrews and Leah Libresco Sargeant, in conversation about “what a right-wing politics of gender should look like.” Andrews apparently caught Douthat’s eye because she had just written an essay for Compact called The Great Feminization, which argues feminism has failed because it has driven masculine virtues out of our institutions. The word “woke” or “wokeness” was used unironically 11 times in the piece: a failsafe sign you should not take anything in it seriously. Andrews continued to just mutter wokeness, wokeness, wokeness in her conversation with Douthat (variants of the word were used 25 times in the conversation), explaining that “the pathology in our institutions known as wokeness is distinctively feminine and feminized … in a very literal sense, our institutions have gone woke because there are more women in them than there used to be.” The conversation unfurls exactly as you’d expect. Carefully cherrypicking examples, Andrews explained that #MeToo was woke, college campuses are too woke, and “the law is currently lopsided in favor of punishing male vices and allowing feminized vices totally free rein.” In response to a question about what constitutes “feminine vices”, Andrews explains that women like “gossiping” and have an “inability to deal with conflict directly”. Sargeant, who has some valid critiques of liberal feminism, does her best to push back against some of this nonsense, but Andrews does most of the talking. Hilariously, towards the end of the conversation Douthat asks Andrews: “What do you like about women, Helen?” She seems unable to answer that question. I know that this is just one man’s podcast rather than, say, a piece by the editorial board, but putting a piece like this on the homepage of the New York Times in 2025 is certainly an interesting decision. Taking the sort of misogynistic nonsense that you see on Fox News and repackaging it as a pseudointellectual debate in a prestigious publication imbues these arguments with a dangerous validity. (If you want a proper intellectual interrogation of gendered inequality and supposedly traditional values, by the way, I suggest you read Angela Saini’s The Patriarchs.) While the New York Times is busy pondering whether liberal feminism has ruined the workplace, women’s rights are being rolled back around the world. In the very same week that this piece came out, Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum was groped by a drunk man as she mingled with citizens on the streets of Mexico City. The leader of a country can’t do her own job without being harassed in public, and the Times wants us to consider whether the workplace has been too feminized. Over in the US, the gender pay gap has widened for the second year in a row, and the Times wants us to consider the possibility that wokeness has gone too far. Mike Johnson, the House speaker, recently shrugged off domestic assault allegations leveled against Republican congressman Cory Mills, and we are expected to ponder, with a straight face, the idea that the workplace is now hostile to men. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, has been accused of sexual assault. (Mills and Hegseth have denied the allegations.) Two out of the five men on the US supreme court have been accused of sexual misconduct. The president of the US is an adjudicated sexual predator, who associated with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, and we are supposed to think that our institutions have been feminized. Interesting times indeed. Mexican president pressing charges after being groped “This is something I experienced as a woman, but it is something that all women in our country experience,” Sheinbaum said after being groped in the street. “If I do not file a complaint, where does that leave all Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what happens to all the other women in the country?” The incident has felt like a personal affront to many women in Mexico, where violence against women and femicide are major problems. But you have to ask yourself, don’t you: has feminism gone too far? Nearly half of LGBTQ+ TV characters cancelled GLAAD’s 2025 report on queer representation on TV shows a small increase from last year’s 468 to 489 LGBTQ+ characters across all platforms. However more than 200 (41%) of those characters won’t return, due to series cancellations, endings or limited series format. New York’s new first lady wore a Jordanian-Palestinian fashion label for Mamdani’s acceptance speech With the genocide in Gaza dropping out of the headlines, it was wonderful to see Rama Duwaji, who is of Syrian descent, wearing a top by Zeid Hijazi. “With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what’s happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,” Duwaji said in an April interview. Duwaji is a talented artist, whose work often examines women in the Middle East.

commentisfree/2025/nov/08/where-is-gaza-peace-process-going,Where is the Gaza ‘peace process’ really going?,"If you started attending one funeral a day beginning 1 January 2025, you would finish in the year 3887. That is how long it would take to mourn every life lost in Gaza. By then, your grandchildren’s great10 grandchildren would be dust, and still you would be burying Palestinian bodies from a “war” Israel insists was about self-defense. Even then, this number does not tell you about the thousands of ways these bodies were burned, torn, crushed and made anything but whole. And yet here we are, watching world leaders gather in Egypt for a “peace summit” last month where the only people absent were Palestinians. The banner read “Peace 2025”, while Palestine’s representatives were barred from the room. Like clockwork, this “peace” has already eroded with Israel violating the ceasefire through continued bombardments. Why does the world act surprised when a country that commits genocide violates the “ceasefire” it orchestrated? Israel lied about 40 beheaded babies to justify a genocide. And now we’re supposed to believe their commitment to peace? In the first month, Israel has broken its own agreement at least 100 times: at least 200 murdered, the yellow line breached, food and fuel blocked, reconstruction prevented. In fact, Israel continues to destroy civilians homes in Gaza. Muhammad al-Hallaq, 10, was executed by Israeli forces in occupied Al-Khalil (Hebron) on 17 October 2025. On 19 October, Israel launched 20 airstrikes in Gaza. They call this “maintaining the ceasefire”. This is the pattern: Israel turns the volume of violence up and down at will, maintaining full dominion over Gaza and the West Bank, then calls each pause a generous “ceasefire”. They violate it immediately, kill Palestinians who dare exist in their own land, then wait for any response, any stone thrown, any rocket fired in defense, to justify their pre-planned retaliation. They did the same thing after they violated the ceasefire in March 2025 during Ramadan. The genocide never ends; it only modulates between active slaughter and slow strangulation. The fact that Israel’s occupation and colonial expansion has continued unpunished by international authorities since 1967 is proof enough that they will never be held to the fire they started. In 1949, immediately after the UN-brokered armistice, Israeli forces began violating demilitarized zones and launching attacks that killed civilians. In 1967, Israel launched a surprise attack on Egypt and Syria despite knowing Egypt posed no serious threat. Between 1981 and 1982, defense minister Ariel Sharon repeatedly violated a UN ceasefire with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon with the Sabra and Shatila massacres, trying to provoke a response that would justify his long-planned invasion. In 2001, as Israeli and Palestinian security officials met to shore up a six-week ceasefire, Israel assassinated a senior Hamas member; nine days later came a retaliatory suicide bombing in Jerusalem. In 2008, Israel violated a months-long truce with Hamas by launching an operation that killed six Hamas members, then used the predictable rocket response to justify Operation Cast Lead, which killed over 1,400 Palestinians, most of them civilians. The method never changes: violate the ceasefire, wait for retaliation, claim victimhood, launch the offensive you’d already planned. Just look at the West Bank, where Palestinians laid down their weapons after the sham that is the Oslo Accords. What did demilitarization bring them? More settlements, more checkpoints, more children shot by snipers, more olive groves burned, more homes demolished. Even complete submission doesn’t stop hunger. In fact, nearly half of all Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since records began in 2005 were killed in just the past two years, 224 children since January 2023 out of 468 total. In 2024, Israel stole 24,258 dunams of Palestinian land, approximately half of all land declared as “state land” since Oslo was signed over 30 years ago. At least 59 new illegal outposts were established in 2024, with 215 Palestinian homes demolished in East Jerusalem. This year, Israel approved its largest settlement expansion since Oslo, 22 new illegal settlements, some deep within Palestine. The UNsecurity council, in Resolution 2334, said Israel’s settlements have “no legal validity and constitutes a fragrant violation under international law”. This is why Israel destroys not just people, but the means of survival itself: the water treatment plants, the agricultural fields, every hospital, every university. Even after the ceasefire, Israel controls Gaza’s agricultural land. Since 1967, more than 800,000 Palestinian olive trees have been illegally uprooted. Not because Hamas hides there, but because Palestinian existence itself is the threat. They learned from American history: between 30 million and 60 million buffalo roamed North America until the US military deliberately supported their slaughter to control Native Americans, reducing the population to fewer than 1,000 by the late 1880s. Within one generation after the buffalo slaughter, the average height of Indigenous peoples dropped by more than an inch, child mortality increased by 16 percentage points, and income remained 25% lower through today. You don’t need to kill every Indigenous person if you destroy their capacity to sustain life. The reservation system taught them that the defeated can be left alive as long as they’re left dependent. Israel won’t be satisfied until Gaza is theirs and the West Bank is gone. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said: “Palestinians will leave in great numbers to third countries.” Heritage minister Amichai Eliyahu declared: “All of Gaza will be Jewish.” They broadcast their intentions while the world pretends surprise at each new violation, each broken agreement, each dead child they claim was a mistake. Thus, the “peace process” has become a piece process, Palestinians robbed of their land piece by piece, until nothing remains but the reservations they’re allocated. Just look to Sinjil in the West Bank, now fenced in; or, Jenin and Nablus having been besieged in the last two years. But how can we even speak of “peace” when we carry Gaza in our bones? Peace cannot exist for any Palestinian, or anyone with eyes still capable of witnessing, who has seen Israel’s depravity. I still hear the Palestinian child wiping his mother’s blood from the floor; I hear the father’s wail as he placed the pieces of his child into a plastic bag; I feel the ways Palestine has been carved, dehumanized, and brutalized to carry out an extermination campaign by those who call themselves “chosen”. These images don’t fade with “ceasefires”. Palestinian self-determination cannot end with Palestinians relegated to the same systems of oppression that destroyed Indigenous peoples across the world. It cannot end with apartheid and rebranded as compromise. True peace requires what terrifies Israel most: equal rights for all from the river to the sea. As America might say, from sea to shining sea. They want us to celebrate when the bombing pauses, to be grateful for the moments between murders, to thank them for allowing a trickle of food into the concentration camp they’ve built. But we know what “peace” built on graves looks like. A genocide can’t bring peace because the logic that justifies mass murder doesn’t stop at borders drawn by killers. But every Palestinian child born is proof that genocide fails, “existence is resistance” as the phrase goes, and we’ve never stopped existing.

Then they sought him out. How Sudan lost ‘a true hero of the war’,"For months, militiamen on the perimeters of El Fasher have asked those few who managed to escape the besieged Sudanese city whether Mohamed Khamis Douda was still inside. They shared videos threatening to kill him, which, as they hoped, made their way to the activist. Even as the hunger and fear of living under siege and bombardment made him desperate to leave, Douda remained inside El Fasher, constantly working to let the outside world know what was happening to the people there. Then, on Sunday 26 October, Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces overran the city and it was too late. His friends and family have confirmed to the Guardian that Douda has been killed. As the official spokesperson for Zamzam, the displacement camp in Sudan’s Darfur region, Douda found himself at the centre of the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe. Injured during the RSF’s massacre there in April in which hundreds of civilians were killed, he had to be carried to the relative safety of nearby El Fasher. Since then, Douda had been in regular contact with the Guardian, describing daily survival in a place that for months has seemed doomed to fall to the RSF. In the lead up to the assault on Sunday, the RSF had squeezed El Fasher’s inhabitants by throttling supplies of food, water and medicine, and building earthen barriers tocontrol who moved in and out. These are some of the accounts Douda shared with the Guardian: Monday 4 August I awake each morning tired from the efforts of the previous day. Our first struggle is the merciless hunger and the second is the constant artillery shelling. Even the glow of a cigarette can alert the drones that fly overhead, so once we finish our meals there is nothing to do but sit in silence, listening to the sound of the buzzing drone and the explosions. This is our daily life, we live in hope that this nightmare will one day end. In the months leading to El Fasher’s fall, Douda said it felt as if he was being followed by drones. Many nights were spent inside a crude bomb shelter made from a metal container buried in the ground. He spent the nights in silence and darkness, afraid of the drones and explosions he could hear around him. Each day started with the search for food. The goal was always to try to find some millet or sorghum flour but as food dwindled, he inevitably had to rely on ombaz – a residue left over from the production of crushing peanuts for oil production. It was usually fed to animals but in El Fasher people were grinding it down and boiling it into an aseeda – the Sudanese staple food usually made from grains such as sorghum or wheat. By the end, Douda said people were eating cattle hides because even the ombaz had run out. He balanced his struggle for survival with trying to support those around him. With friends he helped to deliver food or water and he documented rights abuses while also organising burials for the dead. He believed it was this that attracted the ire of the RSF, when he shared information about Colombian mercenaries fighting on the peripheries of El Fasher. Monday 11 August I awoke to the sounds of explosions in the northern part of the city, near the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people. Then I heard a roar from the south-east. I looked up and saw two drones. I rushed to nearby homes and told them to take shelter. We spent the day in silence, listening to the shelling and machine guns for more than six hours before finally the good news came that the RSF had been expelled. There are 60 martyrs and 100 injured. I went with my friend Ahmed to visit the wounded – there were countless women and children hit by stray bullets. We helped the teams supporting them and organising the burials for the dead. On our way home I suggested to my friend that we leave the city. He went silent, then showed me videos on his phone of young men being tortured by the RSF between El Fasher and the Tawila area after they had tried to leave El Fasher. “Then it’s better for us to stay here until the end,” I said. Douda’s phone often went silent for long periods, but each time he would return with the latest updates from the city. In September, it seemed El Fasher was going to fall when the RSF carried out a heavy attack on the Abu Shouk and Daraja Oula areas, including the killing of dozens while they prayed in a mosque. When he came back online, Douda said people could no longer move and tried to spend their days inside their makeshift bomb shelters but the unbearable heat made it difficult to remain there. Wednesday 24 September I cannot leave the house any more, even to get some food. The people who ran the community kitchens, to feed people, they cannot leave either. Whenever someone moves, the drones attack. I spend all my time thinking about how I can escape the city but as much as I try, I cannot work out how. I hear that the RSF are trying to find me because I speak out against them. When they find people leaving the city they show them my picture and ask if I am still here. Every day, the RSF gets closer and they are ready to kill everyone in El Fasher. The world needs to act quickly. Despite Douda’s regular updates through Facebook and directly to media, nothing changed. Within a day of last Sunday’s attack, news began to come in of arrests such as that of Al Jazeera’s Muammar Ibrahim, and the killing of Siham Hassan, a former MP who had helped to feed people through El Fasher’s community kitchens. Campaign group Avaaz immediately raised concern that the RSF were hunting down activists and searching phones for any sign of communication with the media or human rights groups. “This is the loss of an entire generation of Sudanese activists and Sudanese youth, who not only led the revolution [of 2019] and lived the values of peace, justice and freedom,” says Shayna Lewis, at Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities. “That generation is being strategically wiped out with reports of lists that the RSF have of civil society members.” Lewis describes Douda as a hero who gave his life to highlight atrocities in Zamzam and El Fasher. “I can’t overstate how much of a loss Mohamed’s death is for the wider community of civil society, for Sudan as a country, losing one of the true heroes of the war.”",social,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/02/he-told-the-world-what-was-happening-in-el-fasher-then-they-sought-him-out-how-sudan-lost-a-true-hero-of-the-war,Global development,2025-11-02T12:00:03Z,4
commentisfree/2025/oct/30/ministers-taxes-labour-government-budget-rachel-reeves,Ministers can raise taxes if they come out fighting. But no one in this cowardly Labour government seems able,"Scroll back three years. The person sitting opposite me is yet to take their place at the top of Keir Starmer’s government. Instead, they are a star of the Labour opposition, for whom power advances or recedes with every poll and front page. They have just done a spot of electoral marketing, a photo op at a supermarket 100 or so miles from Westminster, and what they’ve brought home is the politics of the staff. “They’d all voted for Boris.” In this parliamentary office of dull green carpet and brown furniture my interviewee wears a mask of disbelief. Workers – backing an Etonian! “One said, ‘He’s a laugh, innee?’ They all laughed.” Fancy giving your vote away so cheaply! Faster than you can say “Pavlov’s dog”, I demand the next act. Did you ask how these voters feel about their man Boris now – after the pandemic, the parties, the chaos of Brexit? Are they still laughing? But my frontbencher asked no such thing and, slowly, I see why: it smacks of challenge. For the politician in this shop, it is the staff who are the customers – soon to cast their votes – and the customer is always right. Even on something as basic to a democracy as who deserves your cross, to disagree is so disagreeable. All those clenched jaws and gritted teeth surely helped at last summer’s election, when Labour secured a majority a mile wide and an inch deep. Yet now the British government is defined by its inability to argue. Observers rarely point this out, perhaps because it is masked by Labour’s facility with blank slogans (“Change”) and production line of detailed policies. But fighting? This government is constitutionally incapable of such a thing, because that would involve picking sides and making enemies. Can you think of one group, one section or vested interest with whom ministers have traded blows? Not greedy bankers, extractive private-equity barons or even (that old Whitehall favourite) obstreperous trade unionists. After racking my brains, the Downing Street shitlist comes to: Jeremy Corbyn, Michelle Mone, bats and newts. Lest we forget, this is the government that said it heeded “the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community”. The non-dom community! Who gather not at a mosque or synagogue, but on a bobbing yacht to inculcate a sombre-faced Bridget Phillipson (the UK’s minister for equalities) in their more arcane tax practices. The lack of argument is why all those earnest academics cannot discern an actual Starmerism, why the prime minister’s speeches are such utter blancmange. But it is about to prove highly damaging, perhaps even fatal. In less than a month, the government will unveil a budget that will be huge in scope, and hugely painful. The public is likely to pick up a tab for £20-30bn in tax rises and spending cuts. This comes just a year after the last hugely painful budget, which was the second-largest tax raiser in postwar history and which Rachel Reeves swore never to repeat. The big headline out of prime minister’s questions this week is that the government is preparing to break its election promise not to hike any of the big three money-raisers of income tax, national insurance or VAT. That would make the second time they’ve broken that same promise, after increasing NI payments by employers. Right now is when a chancellor should be out making arguments. They should have spent months – years – arguing that the public realm needs investment, and laying out the stats that show the average British worker is taxed less than counterparts in most of western Europe. This weekend, they should be filling in Laura Kuenssberg about the expensive and arduous mission to fix a broken country. And preparing taxpayers for exactly how they’ll have to cough up (loyal backbenchers flying kites, papers from thinktanks, demands from government commissions). This time? Nothing. As things stand, the big reason for the tax rises and thus for misleading an already-suspicious electorate, will be not to pump money into schools and local services, but to observe fiscal rules imposed by Reeves herself last year. Good luck explaining that one on the doorstep. Nigel Farage couldn’t ask for more. That vacuum where ministers ought to be making their case will instead be filled by the right in both parliament and the press, who will bang on about a lying government (which is fair) and a fiscal crisis (which is nonsense). A few of us warned long ago that strapping oneself into a budgetary straitjacket to score a point against the party of Liz Truss was as unnecessary as any stunt by Ed Davey, and far more dangerous. As a new pamphlet from the Fabian Society points out, the fiscal rules have been ripped up by chancellors nine times before. But this lot lack the clarity and firmness even to execute a proper U-turn. The strategy so far is to bitch about “fury” at the Office for Budget Responsibility for belatedly downgrading its forecasts for productivity – the same OBR that Reeves has made the centrepiece of her budget strategy, even promising a “fiscal lock” law. There’ll also be justified complaints about Brexit’s role in weakening the economy. But government is meant to be the business of identifying problems and proposing solutions. If ministers aren’t going to lay out how to significantly tighten trade relationships with Europe, their comments will amount to little more than well-paid kvetching. Rather than public debate, this administration specialises in dripping poison. Aides brief anonymously against Sue Gray or civil service chief Chris Wormald and they taunt MPs who resist welfare cuts as being guilty of “persistent knobheadery”. It is “an absolute vipers’ nest,” as one government official said last weekend. “This is no way to run a country.” You can blame the professionalisation of politics, which has given us a frontbench that, throughout their careers, have been insulated from public argument. Couple that with the chronic diffidence that afflicts many in Labour regarding the party’s enduring lack of popularity with the public. Take Reeves, first elected to parliament in 2010 when New Labour still ran the party. Across her tenure, Labour has been rejected by the public in its Brownite guise, its soft-left incarnation (under Ed Miliband) and its hard-left form. This is the kind of political training that teaches you to fear the public, and never show them who you are or what you believe. But in its essence, politics is a fight – for your side and your beliefs. Think of Tony Blair and the battle he fought with his own party over clause IV, and then against the public sector trade unions (who left him with “scars on my back”). Consider the example of Gordon Brown recruiting a senior banker to head a commission to write a report to soften up the public for a penny on taxes to pay for the NHS. Think of George Osborne arguing for years for spending cuts. And then look at this government, wasting a historic majority and leaving the door to No 10 flapping wide open for Farage and other chancers.

global-development/2025/oct/23/china-uyghur-turkey-morocco-arrest,‘They told me not to speak out’: the woman who took on China – and won her husband’s freedom,"Zeynure Hasan was at home in Istanbul in July 2021 when her husband finally called. It had been four days since she last heard from him as he got ready to board a flight to Casablanca. The silence had been torturous. But the news Idris now shared with her was even worse. He had been arrested and imprisoned on arrival in Morocco and told he was going to be deported to China. “You should call anyone who can help me, anyone who can rescue me,” he told her, before the phone went dead. Zeynure, 31, and Idris, 37, are Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group who make up about half of the population of China’s north-western Xinjiang province. More than a million Uyghurs appear to have been imprisoned in “re-education” camps and subjected to torture over the past decade for acts as ordinary as attending a mosque or wearing a hijab. The couple had joined thousands of others who fled to Turkey in the 2010s. But if they thought they would be safe in exile, they were wrong. Settling in Istanbul, Zeynure became an English teacher and Idris started work as a translator and designer, helping to publish Uyghur news and printed works. They had three children and felt free to live as Muslims. But when one of Idris’s best friends, who worked in a library stocking Uyghur books, was arrested in the summer of 2021, Idris panicked. There were reports that Beijing was pressuring Turkey to deport Uyghurs. Idris felt vulnerable as he had been detained previously, he suspected because of his work with activists and promoting Uyghur culture. He decided to flee to Morocco, but Zeynure, whose Chinese passport had expired, had to stay behind with the children until her husband could apply for a visa for both himself and the family. Leaving Turkey proved to be a terrible mistake. At the airport in Istanbul, border control officials took Idris aside for questioning. “When he was eventually allowed on to the plane he told me how happy he was that they had let him go, but it felt like a trap to me,” says Zeynure. Her worst fears were confirmed when he was taken off the plane and arrested by border officials in Morocco. Over the past decade, China has been using the global police agency Interpol to target political refugees and dissidents and had asked for Idris to be added to the agency’s most-wanted “red notice” list. Zeynure says Turkish officials let him board the flight knowing he would be arrested when he arrived in Morocco. What happened next would convince her that she needed to do what many Uyghurs fear most: defy China, regardless of the consequences. Soon after she received news of her husband’s arrest, Zeynure got an unexpected phone call from her parents in Xinjiang. She had been cut off from her family since they had visited her in Turkey in 2016 and been imprisoned for several months upon their return to China. Her parents had a chilling message. “They said, ‘We know your husband is not with you. Maybe we can help you,’” says Zeynure. “I knew there must be some police there with them and just acted like I didn’t know anything. But they persisted and told me not to do anything to help my husband. ‘Don’t do anything except feeding your children,’ they told me. ‘Don’t say anything bad about China.’” But with her husband’s life at risk, the softly spoken Zeynure was not going to stay quiet. She had grown up witnessing women having their hijabs ripped off in public by the police and had been determined to live in a country with religious freedom. “Before my husband was arrested in Morocco, I didn’t do anything. I was just looking after my family; I didn’t even have Facebook, Twitter or these kinds of things. But I had to do something to rescue my husband – I had to tell the truth to the world. Everyone knows Uyghurs sent to China will be tortured or die. They [the Chinese government] pushed me to speak out.” *** Zeynure has two distinct types of memories of growing up in Xinjiang. The first was of blissful days spent in the countryside with her grandparents, who were farmers. “I’d play with the sheep and chickens. I don’t know if I will ever have that kind of opportunity again. The family around the house and farm. It was too beautiful, like a scene from a story.” The second was as a Muslim Uyghur in Xinjiang, of school holidays cut short by forced teachings of “communist songs” and being banned from going to the mosque or observing Ramadan. China says it is tackling extremism through ‘controlling illegal religious activities’ and ‘vocational education and training centres’, but other countries, including the US, say its actions amount to genocide. Zeynure says she never felt free to follow her religious beliefs in Xinjiang. “People who went on pilgrimage to Mecca [in Saudi Arabia] were arrested and sent to prison and told they must have some problem in their brain. “They [the Chinese government] wanted Uyghur people to forget their religion and culture. They said ‘you should believe in us, we gave you jobs and this beautiful life here’,” says Zeynure. She finally decided to leave China after returning home from university in Eastern China to a growing crackdown on religious freedoms in 2011. It was then that she was introduced to Idris by one of her school friends. “She knew we both had made the decision to go abroad and told us maybe we could meet and go together.” Zeynure says she was immediately reassured by Idris. “I realised he was very truthful and shy, and couldn’t tell lies or do anything bad. There were some Uyghur boys at university who wanted to marry me, but Idris was different.” Within two months they were married and ready to leave for a new life in Turkey. They knew it was an Islamic country with many Muslims and Uyghurs already living there, with a similar language and shared ethnicity. “It was like Uyghurs’ second home,” says Zeynure. As a teacher and designer, they could also help the community in exile. “There are many children now in China growing up without Uyghur culture or language so we think it’s our duty to not let it die out,” she says. But their relief at finding a place of safety overseas was short-lived. Beijing has become a global leader in targeting dissidents and critics living in exile through the use of electronic surveillance, threats and physical assault. But what Idris was subjected to was a newer tool of repression: using China’s growing economic leverage to force other countries to bend to its will, including detaining and deporting Uyghurs it wants to silence. After the call from Idris, and discovering he had an Interpol red notice hanging over him, Zeynure knew she only had a short window of opportunity to try to stop his extradition to China. She immediately contacted as many Uyghur support groups as she could find listed online in Europe and the US and begged for help. She was fearless despite China having already shown a willingness to go after the relatives of other targets. Zeynure started protesting with her children at the Moroccan embassy in Istanbul, and posting updates on social media. To her surprise, copycat protests soon followed in Morocco demanding Idris’s release. Moroccan officials were forced to put out a statement saying his deportation was a matter for the courts to decide. In early August 2021, Interpol cancelled Idris’s red notice after being pressed to review his case by human rights groups. But that did not stop a Moroccan court later ruling he should still be extradited to China. Zeynure says there was huge diplomatic pressure from Beijing, which made little sense for someone who had not been convicted of any crime or act of terrorism. “I was told the Chinese government said it would close all its factories in the country if Morocco released him.” In late December 2021, the UN intervened and asked for time to conduct a review of Idris’s case, citing the risk he could face torture or arbitrary detention if sent back to China. It later requested his release, but Morocco still appeared unwilling to upset the Chinese government, which was demanding his extradition. Turkey also appeared unwilling for Idris to return. “If the Turkish government had said ‘we want Idris, you can send him’, maybe they [Morocco] would have, but they didn’t care about his case any more. From the beginning, Turkey didn’t get involved because it doesn’t want to be an enemy with China now.” As the months and then years passed with no resolution, Zeynure remained courageous in continuing to protest and keep Idris’s name in the media spotlight. Her husband needed her more than ever. Stuck in prison and permitted just three short calls a week to his family, Zeynure says Idris was losing hope. “He was very afraid and couldn’t sleep. Every time the prison door opened, he said, ‘I thought they would deport me to China’.” Zeynure says the children were also suffering, especially their youngest, now aged six. “She became very sensitive and not really a social child any more.” But as Idris entered his fourth year in detention without charge, there was hope at last of a route to safety from an unlikely source: the new Trump administration. *** The US has long accused China of genocide in its treatment of Uyghurs. As he took up his new role as US secretary of state in January 2025, Marco Rubio described it as “one of the most horrifying things that’s ever happened”. “These are people who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and religion … They’re being put into … what they call re-education centres. They’re being stripped of their identity, their children’s names are being changed,” he told senators in the US. Less than a month later, the US had convinced Morocco to quietly defy China and release Idris. On 12 February, Zeynure got a call to say her husband was out of prison and travelling with his lawyer to a hotel in Casablanca. From there he was taken to the UN offices and then the US embassy in the city as he waited to board a flight to Washington DC. But there was to be no public announcement of his freedom as everyone involved, including Zeynure, was sworn to secrecy. Even with the US agreeing to rescue him there was a fear of what could happen if the Chinese found out Idris had been released before he had left Morocco. “I worried he wouldn’t make it on to the plane, but they [the lawyers] said there wouldn’t be any problem because there were some American officials from the embassy who would go with him. I was crying and laughing. My emotions were all over the place,” says Zeynure. On the evening of 14 February 2025, Zeynure finally got the call the family had been waiting for: Idris was safe. He had arrived in Washington. But for Zeynure and the children, the wait for the family to be reunited went on. Idris was granted a visa to stay in the US, but was told that applying for his family to be able to join him would likely take many years. Fearing the Trump administration’s growing hostility towards migrants and refugees could stop them ever being reunited, Idris applied for asylum for himself and his family in Canada. It would take another seven months, but last month Zeynure and the family were granted a permanent immigration visa to relocate to Canada. On 24 September, Zeynure and the children set off on a flight from Istanbul. Idris was there waiting at Toronto airport. The family were together at last. “As soon as I saw him all my anxieties disappeared. It’s been so many years of fear and worrying because we didn’t know what would happen next. If a normal person commits a crime or does something bad they are arrested and convicted and told when they will be released. “The most unfair thing is that if you are Uyghur, you can be arrested without reason and you can’t know when you will be released. My children just wanted to see their father again and hug him.”",social,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/23/china-uyghur-turkey-morocco-arrest,Global development,2025-10-23T12:00:37Z,4
world/2025/nov/03/afghanistan-earthquake-death-toll-reportedly-damages-blue-mosque,Powerful Afghan earthquake leaves at least 20 dead and hundreds injured,"A powerful 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook northern Afghanistan before dawn on Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring more than 640 others, 25 critically, a disaster management official said. Health officials said the numbers could rise. The US Geological Survey said the quake’s epicentre was located 22km (14 miles) south-west of the town of Khulm, and that it struck at 12.59am at a depth of 28km (17 miles). In August, an earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people. The impoverished country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions. Buildings tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood, many poorly built. Monday’s earthquake was also felt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of the northern Balkh province, Afghan officials said, where footage on social media showed slight damage to the historic Blue Mosque. Several bricks fell from the walls but the mosque remained intact. The centuries-old site, one of Afghanistan’s most revered religious landmarks, is a major gathering place during Islamic and cultural festivals. The deputy spokesperson for Afghanistan’s national disaster management authority, Qari Taj Mohammad Hemat, said the earthquake had struck Balkh, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul, and Kunduz provinces and had left 20 people dead and 643 others injured, 25 in critical condition. Earlier, Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the ministry of public health, said the dead and more than 500 of the injured had been brought to hospitals in Balkh and Samangan provinces. Rescuers were on the scene and the figures were changing, he added. In the nearby province of Badakhshan, the quake partly or completely destroyed 800 houses in one village in the Shahr-e-Bozorg district, said Ihsanullah Kamgar, spokesperson for the provincial police headquarters. But with a lack of internet in the remote area, there were still no accurate casualty figures, he added. Yousaf Hammad, a spokesperson for Afghanistan’s disaster management agency, said most of the injured sustained minor wounds and were discharged after treatment. In Khulm, near the epicentre, people dug through the rubble of collapsed mud brick homes with shovels and picked through debris to salvage what belongings they could. “It was one o’clock in the morning, and there was a strong earthquake. When I came out, the houses were destroyed and the air was very polluted,” said Ahmad Zia, a local resident. “We were busy rescuing the injured. We pulled the bodies of two people from the rubble, and their funerals will be held today.” Another resident, Abdul Mubin, said he had been sleeping in his shop when the earthquake struck. “I saw that everything was destroyed. People had suffered a lot of financial losses,” he said. “Many people’s houses were destroyed and their household goods were under the rubble.” In the Afghan capital, Kabul, the defence ministry announced that rescue and emergency teams had reached the quake areas in Balkh and Samangan, which suffered the most damage. The teams were transporting the injured and assisting others, it said. The Taliban government’s chief spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, posted on X that the earthquake had caused casualties and financial loss. He said government organisations were working to get the help needed. The quake was also felt in Kabul and several other provinces. The defence ministry said a rockslide briefly blocked a main mountain highway linking Kabul with Mazar-i-Sharif, but the road was later reopened. It said some people who were injured and trapped along the highway were transported to hospital. In Islamabad, Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, expressed his sorrow and grief over the loss of lives. He offered condolences to the families of the victims, prayed for the swift recovery of the injured, and said Pakistan stood with the Afghan people at this difficult time. The two countries are engaged in rounds of peace talks amid heightened tension after deadly clashes on the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Pakistan accuses the Taliban government of sheltering members of the Pakistani Taliban and failing to curb cross-border attacks. Afghan officials reject the allegations, saying they seek good relations. Another round of peace talks is scheduled for this week in Istanbul, Turkey. The UN in Afghanistan said on X that its teams were on the ground assessing needs and delivering urgent aid. “We stand with the affected communities and will provide the necessary support,” the post said. A magnitude 6 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan on 31 August near the border with Pakistan, killing more than 2,200 people. On 7 October 2023, a magnitude 6.3 quake followed by strong aftershocks left at least 4,000 people dead, according to the Taliban government.",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/afghanistan-earthquake-death-toll-reportedly-damages-blue-mosque,World news,2025-11-03T14:19:11Z,3
world/2025/oct/31/sudan-civil-war-el-fasher-explained,Sudan’s brutal civil war – what has happened in El Fasher?,"Another devastating chapter in Sudan’s brutal civil war has taken place as the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces captured El Fasher from the army after an 18-month siege that trapped tens of thousands of civilians in the city in Darfur. The RSF now controls all major urban centres in Darfur, a development that raises the possibility the country could face partition. What has happened in El Fasher this week? In a statement on Sunday, the RSF said it had “extended control over the city of El Fasher from the grip of mercenaries and militias”. The day after, the Sudanese army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, confirmed that his forces had withdrawn from the city “to a safer location”, effectively conceding its loss. Since then the RSF has been accused of killing hundreds of unarmed civilians in ethnically motivated attacks. The group has also been accused of hunting down specific individuals, detaining civilians, and releasing them only after receiving ransom payments – a pattern consistent with what happened after the RSF took over other major cities. Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab has said the level of violence is comparable to the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide. How do we know about what is going on? International journalists are not on the ground in Darfur, and news agencies have been unable to reach residents in El Fasher, where the Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate reports that communications have been cut off under a media blackout. Much of what is known about the atrocities has instead come to light from video footage – much of it filmed by the RSF themselves – geolocated by journalists and human rights analysts; testimony from survivors who escaped to the nearby town of Tawila; and, crucially, satellite image analysis conducted by the Yale lab. Videos have emerged showing “dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead, surrounded by RSF fighters”, according to the UN. Separately, footage shared by pro-democracy activists appeared to show bodies scattered on the ground alongside burnt-out vehicles. In a report released on Tuesday, the Yale lab said El Fasher “appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa and Berti indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”. Analysts also identified what appeared to be “door-to-door clearance operations” across the city, where militants went house to house committing a series of acts of violence. The Yale team said satellite images also showed large “clusters” consistent with adult human bodies and red discoloration on the ground. Who are the RSF and what are the origins of Sudan’s civil war? The RSF was officially formed in 2013 from the remnants of the Janjaweed militia, deputed by Sudan’s former authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir to suppress a tribal rebellion in the Darfur region. That operation ended with the genocide of up to 300,000 people. A civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese army began in April 2023 after a power struggle between the two forces, and the conflict quickly spread across the country. Both sides have been accused of a litany of human rights violations and war crimes against civilians. The US, UN and others have also determined that the RSF has committed genocide and mass rape against ethnic Masalit and non-Arab communities in Darfur. In August that year, famine was declared in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, south of El Fasher. In April, the RSF killed as many as 2,000 people when it seized the camp, which at the time housed 500,000 people. What role is the international community playing? The world appeared to be placing some focus on Sudan earlier this year when a conference held in London brought together 17 countries, as well as the EU and African Union, to discuss the conflict. It was accompanied by some new pledges of aid, and was billed as an effort to build a new consensus on a way forward. But there was widespread criticism that some of the countries at the conference were allegedly involved with the conflict, most notably the United Arab Emirates. Sudan’s military government has accused the UAE of supplying arms to the RSF, which the Emiratis have denied. In April, a leaked UN experts’ report found “multiple” flights from the UAE, as transport planes made apparently deliberate attempts to avoid detection as they flew into bases in Chad, where arms smuggling across the border into Darfur has been monitored. The UAE’s relationship with the RSF can be traced back to the 2015 Yemen war, where the RSF was used to recruit fighters who were sent to Yemen to fight for the Saudi and UAE forces. The UAE’s interest in Sudan is also down to its gold, most which has ended up in the UAE in recent years.",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/31/sudan-civil-war-el-fasher-explained,World news,2025-10-31T10:14:32Z,3
world/2025/oct/27/kathryn-bell-obituary,Kathryn Bell obituary,"My friend Kathryn Bell, who has died aged 91, was a founder member of several organisations promoting creativity and human rights. In 1976, Kathryn and her partner, Elsa Wallace Beckett, a wheelchair-user, set up Gemma, a support and social network in London for lesbians with disabilities, which went on to become a national group, with more than 100 members at its peak. Kathryn and Elsa were also involved in Action and Rights of Disabled People in Newham, east London, joining activities such as blocking the local high street in East Ham to draw attention to the lack of anti-discrimination legislation. They also ran Docklands Drop In, offering arts and crafts and outings. Gay Authors Workshop was founded in 1978; Elsa and Kathryn joined other LGBTQ+ writers in shaping and running the group and regularly hosted meetings, which ended with a vegan buffet. Eventually, Kathryn became the GAW secretary, treasurer, newsletter editor and membership liaison. Kathryn was a fine writer of short stories and poetry. Examples of her work appear in anthologies, but she was more concerned with promoting Elsa’s work and also encouraging and nurturing others with feedback and advice. In 1999, in the face of mainstream publishers’ seeming indifference to LGBTQ+ writing, she was instrumental in setting up and administering an authors’ collective, which became Paradise Press, and has published more than 40 books to date. Born and raised in Glasgow, the daughter of Christina (nee Hutcheson), a store worker, and Francis Bell, an electrician, Kathryn attended Bellahouston academy, Ibrox (1946-48). In her late teens, in 1951, she accompanied her parents to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where her father was working on engineering projects. Becoming a police officer there, Kathryn won an award for bravery and was promoted in 1959 to be the first female inspector in the Northern Rhodesia Police Force. In Africa she met Elsa, who had been brought up in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); they became life partners. Together they returned to Britain in 1966 and settled in east London.

world/2025/oct/22/first-edition-maccabi-tel-aviv,"Wednesday briefing: Making sense of the Maccabi Tel Aviv saga, where law and disorder fumbled with fandom","Good morning. In the end, the decision that capped the controversy over the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans attending their away match against Aston Villa was taken not in Birmingham, or even Westminster – but Tel Aviv. On Monday night, a statement on the team’s website said the club would be declining any allocation even if the ban was reversed. Because of “hate-filled falsehoods”, it added, “a toxic atmosphere has been created, which makes the safety of our fans wishing to attend very much in doubt”. That means that the government’s efforts to make their attendance possible are now academic. But it also heads off a potential nightmare scenario for those in the UK who have decried the ban: Maccabi fans being allowed to attend, and serious disorder breaking out as a result. With a few exceptions, there was a broad consensus in British politics that the local authority’s decision was wrong. But much of the discussion has ignored the rational case for that decision – which was taken in response to some of the worst football-related violence of recent years. Today’s newsletter attempts to unpick a tortuous political saga where fandom and antisemitism once again became a political football. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK news | Family courts will no longer work on the presumption that having contact with both parents is in the best interests of a child, in a landmark change that domestic abuse campaigners have said “will save so many children’s lives”. Ukraine | Plans to hold a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest have been put on hold as Ukraine and its European allies rallied in pushing for a ceasefire without territorial concessions from Kyiv. Last night, Russian drones and missiles killed two people in Kyiv and damaged key energy facilities. Covid inquiry | Boris Johnson has rejected claims that his government failed to prepare for school closures at the outbreak of the pandemic, telling the Covid-19 inquiry that it would be “amazing” if the Department for Education (DfE) had not realised that plans were needed. Environment | Coal use hit a record high around the world last year despite efforts to switch to clean energy, imperilling the world’s attempts to rein in global heating, according to the annual State of Climate Action report published on Wednesday. Business | Almost half a million workers are to receive a pay boost after it was announced that the real living wage paid voluntarily by 16,000 UK companies will rise to £13.45 an hour in April. In depth: The mixed messages and repercussions of a controversy where all is not as it seems The Maccabi statement did not identify what finally led the club to decline any offer of tickets that might be forthcoming. But one plausible claim reported yesterday underlines what a toxic mess the situation has become: according to Jewish News, the final straw was Tommy Robinson’s promise to attend the match. A source said: “With Robinson’s supporters potentially posing as Maccabi fans on the streets of Birmingham, we concluded that the risk had become unacceptable.” In other words, even Maccabi recognised that an extremist intervention could put innocent fans at risk. Views will vary on whether that is the fault of those who ordered a ban in the first place, or those who sought to reverse a decision taken by those closest to the risk. We can, at least, try to make sense of how we got here. *** Why was the ban put in place? The decision was taken by Birmingham’s safety advisory group, which is responsible for issuing safety certificates for football matches, with the support of West Midlands police and the UK football policing unit. After the UK-wide body provided West Mids police with access to details of a previous outbreak of trouble in Amsterdam involving Maccabi fans (pictured above), the local force classified the fixture as high risk. Primarily on the basis of that evidence, the safety advisory group – which includes police representatives, event organisers, local authority officials and emergency planners – decided to ban Maccabi fans from attending. Vikram Dodd has a detailed report on the basis of the decision, which makes clear that it was largely the result of concerns about Maccabi fans – but also failed to consider that it might be interpreted as a surrender to antisemitism. Every English Westminster party other than the Greens opposed the decision, and the government, without directly overruling the safety advisory group, said it was working to make resources available to reverse it. Keir Starmer called the decision wrong and said “the role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game”. That drew criticism from some with experience of similar issues, with Professor Lucy Easthope, an expert in emergency planning, warning of the appearance of interference, and saying that the prime minister had shown “terrible instincts”. Nazir Afzal, former chief executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said: “When it comes to football related violence, the police – not politicians, not armchair pundits – know what’s safe and what isn’t.” *** Whose safety was at issue? One claim made repeatedly in the days since the decision was announced is the idea that Jewish Maccabi fans have been banned for their own safety. In the Spectator, Brendan O’Neill characterised the decision as “punishment of Maccabi fans to ‘save them’ from Brits who hate the Jewish homeland”. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that it “sends a horrendous and shameful message: there are parts of Britain where Jews simply cannot go”. In parliament, the Labour MP Graham Stringer said: “It would be a disgrace and a shame if this country could not guarantee the security of a group of Jewish fans, coming from Israel, walking down our streets.” But those arguments seriously oversimplify the apparent basis of the ban. The trouble in Amsterdam, which has a large Muslim population, was initially characterised as an unprovoked antisemitic attack on Israeli fans. But the full picture that emerged suggested that the trouble had involved Maccabi fans attacking Muslims in the city, chanting things like “Why is there no school in Gaza? There are no children left there,” and instigating some of the earliest confrontations. There were also plainly antisemitic elements on the other side, including a call for a “Jew hunt” and what the mayor described as “antisemitic hit-and-run assaults” that drew no distinction between hooligans and ordinary fans. (We covered this at length in the newsletter last November.) Taken as a whole, the picture presented by this and other past incidents suggests that ordinary Jewish fans of Maccabi could be at risk should trouble arise in Birmingham, an obviously intolerable outcome – but that Maccabi’s hooligan element have a history of instigating disorder, and that nearby residents and fans, including members of Birmingham’s large Muslim community, would plausibly be at risk from them. *** What else do we know about Maccabi’s ‘Fanatic’ element? In that First Edition from last year, James Montague – an expert on football hooliganism – provided a useful explanation of the history of the “Fanatics”, the subset of Maccabi’s organised “Ultra” support who are violent. Traditionally, he said, “you have a very highly developed, very political culture” among Israeli club fanbases. Maccabi once fell in the middle of that spectrum, but that has shifted in recent years. Montague went on: You have to understand that as the politics of Israel changes, so do the politics of the Ultras. They are organised young men, many of whom have been in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] because of conscription, and what they say and chant tracks where the country is.’ As a result, he said, there is a much stronger ultra-nationalist element within the Maccabi fanbase today. ‘That isn’t something about the club, per se. It’s something about how Israel is changing.’ In recent years, evidence has mounted of that shift. In Athens last year, Maccabi fans beat a man carrying a Palestinian flag ahead of their match against Olympiacos. They fought local residents in Cyprus in 2023 before a match against AEK Larnaca. A match against Turkish side Beşiktaş was relocated to Hungary, where it was played behind closed doors, because of fears of disorder. And there is an extensive history of racist chanting against Arabs. The chaos in Amsterdam was the most extreme example of that tendency. The Tel Aviv derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was called off on Sunday because of rioting and what Israeli police described as “risks to human life”. Ironically, there is good evidence that rather than being violence instigated by either fanbase, that disorder was the product of a growing tendency among Israeli police to target fans. This excellent Middle East Eye report has more on that. *** Were there other factors in the outcry over the ban? In a statement to the House of Commons, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, sought to put the government’s opposition to the decision in a broader context. The government’s stance, she said, was “set against a backdrop of rising antisemitism in this country and across the world, and of an attack on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed”. Supporters of that argument say that if the issue is whether the local police force has sufficient resources, they should be provided by central government, which Nandy said would be made available. Some have also argued that this is an attempt to introduce by the back door a ban on Israeli teams playing internationally: a petition promoted by the independent local MP Ayoub Khan before the decision was made said that “hosting such teams sends a message of normalisation and indifference to mass atrocities”. Councillors Waseem Zaffar and Mumtaz Hussain, who sit on the safety advisory group, have made the same argument. Fifa has come under pressure to institute such a ban given that some Israeli teams appear to be in breach of its rules against professional sides playing on occupied territory. Meanwhile, the Guardian’s Jonathan Liew noted the dizzying contortions that have led to “choosing to stand with the far-right foreign football hooligan against the local police force” – but also raised the “increasingly sinister securitisation of football fans at matches”. But as his piece suggests, it is possible to recognise that pattern and view the Maccabi decision as being based on a specific threat assessment, rather than evidence of a local authority cowed by antisemitism. *** Is there a precedent for this decision? Another claim repeated a lot in recent days – including from Nandy herself – is that this is an unprecedented step. But while such decisions are fairly unusual, it isn’t really accurate to say this is a unique case. Across the continent, there are numerous recent cases of away fans being banned from European fixtures. Feyenoord fans were banned from a game against Roma in Rome last year; Galatasaray fans were banned from Leverkusen in February; Benfica fans were banned from Marseille in April; Eintracht Frankfurt fans have been banned from attending next month’s match against Napoli. There are other examples besides. In England, Uefa banned Eintracht Frankfurt fans from Arsenal in 2019, and Red Star Belgrade fans from Tottenham in the same year. And in 2023, after violent clashes before Legia Warsaw’s match with Aston Villa, West Midlands police denied entry to all away supporters. What is true is that the Legia Warsaw case is the only recent example of a UK local authority banning away fans because of the risk of violence – and was a decision taken live, rather than pre-emptively. But it doesn’t follow that the Maccabi decision is evidence of a different analysis. Partly, it’s because such serious threats are relatively rare; and partly, it’s because where Uefa has made a decision, there is no reason for the local authority to act.

The population has almost halved since 1985, but thanks to 274 dedicated patrol groups, their fortunes may slowly start to turn around. This decline is in part due to traffic: toads travel a fair distance from where they have been hibernating (often woodland ) towards a large pond to mate. This often means travelling across country roads, but many don’t make it. It is estimated several hundred thousand toads are killed on UK roads every year. Enter toad patrol groups, who carry toads across roads in buckets, as well as counting the number (dead and alive) they find.

commentisfree/2025/oct/19/dad-family-death-dying-love,"My dad cursed our family and left us. But after his death, he followed me everywhere","My father died nine months ago and last night he drove me home in a taxi. We knew something was wrong when my father stopped taking his insulin and started leaving his flat at night without his shoes because there were “people in the plants” and the floor was made of “muddy water”. After several tests, he was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, which causes hallucinations and a rapid decline in cognition. He moved to a nursing home in central Stockholm, and I told myself everything would end well. Dad would finally get proper medication, physical therapy, new teeth, foot care and eye treatment for his declining vision. I imagined coming by with my sons, and we would finally be able to talk about everything: why he disappeared, what we might have done differently and why I still held on to the naive hope that he would apologise. In the first weeks in the home, he would often tell the nurses the story of how he met my mother. He was a 21-year-old Tunisian store detective, using his impeccable eyesight to catch shoplifters in a mall in Lausanne, Switzerland. She was an 18-year-old Swedish student secretary who was in the country to learn French. They met at a pub. He quoted Baudelaire. She went back to Sweden. Years of letters. A reunion in Stockholm. After their first kiss, Dad asked Mom what her family name, Bergman, meant in Swedish. “Mountain man,” she said. He couldn’t believe it. His family name, Khemiri, also meant “mountain man” – but in Arabic. Cue strings. Cue destiny. Cue love for ever, for ever ever, forever ever? (André 3000 voice). Their names connected them in a world that seemed to claim their love was impossible, because they didn’t share class, background, religion, skin colour and a mother tongue. It wasn’t 100% true. Khemiri doesn’t literally mean “mountain man” in Arabic. But my father was from Jendouba, Tunisia, near the Kroumirie mountains, and Kroumirie kind of sounds like Khemiri, so I guess it was true enough. My father’s most crushing loss was the divorce. When Mom told him he had to move out, Dad cursed me and my brothers: “Your mother will never be able to raise three boys on her own,” he said. “You will end up homeless drug addicts.” He disappeared. I spent my life trying to prove him wrong. I became a writer, my middle brother an actor, the youngest a psychiatrist. None of us are homeless. But whenever I’ve gone through a breakup since, I hear my father’s voice: “I told you not to trust anyone.” After my father moved to the nursing home, I received a fellowship in New York and moved to the US with my family. He never forgave me for leaving Sweden. He would call five times a day to let me know the nurses were trying to poison him. Mossad had bugged his room. His plants were still full of people, and the muddy water on the floor was rising by the day. He wanted to go to Tunisia, or Paris, or New York. He wanted to be anywhere but there. “Nobody has come to see me in weeks,” he said, which was strange because I knew my brothers had been there the day before. “All I need is some physical presence,” he added, which struck me as slightly ironic, since all his now-grown children had felt the same way when he disappeared. When we hung up, my sons asked me what was wrong with Grandpa. I tried to explain. I told them: he’s sick, he’s old, he comes from a poor background, a complicated country, he had eight siblings, his mother couldn’t read or write, he worked all his life to achieve financial stability, he was convinced money could create freedom and help him escape a painful past he never wanted to talk about. He had a thousand dreams, sold watches, imported perfumes, drove subways, bartended, taught languages – always dreaming of that big break that would turn everything around. “Did he ever get rich?” my oldest son asked. “It depends on what you mean by rich,” I said. “He managed to save some money. But he lost a lot of people along the way.” I hugged my sons and promised myself I wouldn’t repeat my father’s mistakes – knowing full well I would make my own. * * * A few months before his death, he called me to say he was lost in the city. It was raining, someone had stolen his leather jacket and he couldn’t find his way back to the nursing home. His voice trembled with fear. “If you turn on the camera, I can guide you,” I said. It took him a few minutes to find the button. He showed me his surroundings. “But Dad,” I said, “You’re sitting in your room.” “Are you sure?” he said, looking at his walls, his TV, the Tabarka jazz festival poster, as if for the first time. A few days before he passed, I was in Paris to give a reading from my latest novel, The Sisters. It follows three siblings over 35 years as they try to break free from a family curse. I chose a chapter about a father who forces his son to cut off his hair and then helps a female shopkeeper who is threatened by a drunk. The chapter ends with this line: “I enjoyed turning my father into a story; somehow, it gave me power over him, it seemed like the only power I had.” The next day, my brother texted: “Dad has stopped eating and drinking. The doctors are considering palliative care.” I just stood there, blinking at the screen, trying to process how utterly powerless my stories were in the face of death. I flew to Stockholm and spent three days and nights with my brothers at his bedside. He was breathing but couldn’t speak. He was looking at us but didn’t recognise us. He looked like a baby bird, with thin wings for arms and empty holes where there had once been white teeth. “He can still hear you,” the nurses said, and we believed them. We didn’t leave his side. We played Satie on repeat. We told stories. Do you remember that time when he caught two rabbits by hand, killed mosquitoes lurking on the ceiling with towels, pretended to eat a wasp, danced like James Brown, defended us from racist skinheads, quoted Disney films, forgot our girlfriends’ names, warned us never to get involved in politics, told us we were crazy for trusting the banking system. Sure, death seemed to be winning, but our stories put up a good fight. Dementia had transformed his mind into a desert, but I imagined our stories planting seeds that might wake him up. Soon, terminal lucidity would kick in. Soon he would speak. We kept hoping for an ending that would make sense. One afternoon, we filled the hospital room with people: my mom, my brothers’ girlfriends, their children, older kids keeping their distance from his stiff body, toddlers climbing into bed without fear. For a moment, I saw the flutter of a smile on his lips. But still no words. My middle brother was the last one to hear him speak. The day before I arrived, Dad looked up and said: “Tell Per-Olof I still love his daughter.” Per-Olof Bergman, my Swedish grandfather, died in 1993. My parents divorced in 1995. My father died in 2025. * * * I have spent 22 years writing about families, perhaps as a rebellion against death. Every time I receive a call telling me someone has died, my brain whispers: “You can write about this.” It happened when my first girlfriend took her own life. When a childhood friend died in a car crash. When my grandfather died, and my grandmother, and my cousin and my uncle. For years, I felt guilty about that reflex. Now I see it as a defence mechanism – an illusion of control: “Don’t worry. You’re not powerless. You can come up with an evocative first sentence and an effective ending. You can turn your loss into words and replace everyone who dies with sentences.” And on some level, we all do this: we lose and we tell stories. We tell stories and then we die. The best-case scenario is that time kills us. No wonder we search frantically for control, for narrative structure, for a happy ending. But sitting next to my dying father, I didn’t think about writing. Maybe because I’d already mourned him. Once, he told me: “Everything you have, you got from me. You wouldn’t be a writer without me.” I think he was right, but I suspect his absence shaped me more than his presence. His breaths grew shallow. We said our goodbyes, we forgave him, we cried. We waited. We waited some more. We said goodbye at least eight times. At 2.30am, the third night, his breathing slowed. I woke my brothers. We sat beside him. His forehead was cold. Long silences. Then another breath. Silence. Breath. Silence. Breath. Then silence. A brief moment of pain. A gurgling sound. Silence. He didn’t wake to say he loved us. He didn’t explain why things turned out the way they did. He breathed, and breathed, and then he stopped. After his death, I flew to Tunisia to collect letters, photos and meet mourning cousins and aunts. Even though he was gone, I kept seeing him everywhere. He drove every car, stood behind every bar. The security guard who told me the mosque in Tunis was closing had his eyes. The bald man who tried to lure me down an alley in the souk had his hands and homemade tattoos. My aunt had his smell; my uncle his laughter. I had never been to Tunisia without him – and my brain wouldn’t allow him to die. Back in New York, he appeared less often. In April, a young version of him sold halal food on 47th Street. In June, a middle-aged version refereed my son’s flag football game in New Jersey. “Didn’t the referee look like your grandfather?” I asked on our way home. My son had headphones on and didn’t respond. My father died nine months ago and last night he drove me home in a taxi. I leaned forward to see if it was really him. Same neck, same hair, same shoulders. But when we hit a pothole on Flatbush Avenue, he turned to me and said: “Sorry.” Jonas Hassen Khemiri is a Swedish novelist and playwright.

world/2025/oct/15/first-edition-flood-risk-britain,"Wednesday briefing: The new, devastating flood risk facing nearly all of Britain","Good morning. For years, whenever I read about parts of Britain being wrecked by flooding, it always felt like something distant – because until your house is flooded, it’s hard to imagine it happening, isn’t it? Not any more. According to a Guardian investigation, millions more homes across England, Scotland and Wales are at risk of devastating floods. In England alone, the number of properties exposed to flooding is expected to rise by more than a quarter, from 6.3m to 8m. The story gets worse for those in high-risk areas for flash flooding – which is harder to predict and protect against – where the frequency could surge by up to 66% by 2050. The picture is so bleak that, startlingly, some towns may one day have to be abandoned altogether. This time, however, the warnings are not coming from environmental campaigners but from leaders in the insurance industry, who are sounding the alarm about extreme weather events driven by the climate crisis. They warn that large swathes of housing and commercial property in densely populated areas are among the most vulnerable to devastating flooding. To dig into the investigation’s findings and explore what communities and the government must now do, I spoke to Matthew Taylor, an environment correspondent for the Guardian. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war | The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced its first test on Tuesday when Israel said the flow of aid into the devastated Palestinian territory would be cut by half and the crucial Rafah border crossing with Egypt would not open as planned, blaming Hamas for delays in the return of bodies of hostages. UK child abuse inquiry | Keir Starmer’s national grooming gangs inquiry has stalled amid wrangles over its remit and difficulties in finding a senior legal figure willing to become its chair, the Guardian has been told. Economics | The global economy has shown “unexpected resilience” to Donald Trump’s tariffs, but the full impact is yet to be felt, the IMF has warned. The forecast for economic growth in the UK has also been modestly increased, from 1.2% to 1.3% this year – though slightly downgraded next year, also to 1.3%. Madagascar | Andry Rajoelina, the president of Madagascar, has said he fled the country in fear for his life after a military rebellion but did not announce his resignation in a speech broadcast on social media. They were Rajoelina’s first public comments since the a military unit called Capsat turned against his government in an apparent coup. Music | D’Angelo, the Grammy-winning R&amp;B singer who helped pioneer the sound of neo-soul, has died after a struggle with pancreatic cancer. He was 51. In depth: ‘It is absolutely a sign that the climate crisis is here and escalating’ Every constituency in Great Britain is expected to face greater flood risk in the years ahead, according to a study by the insurer Aviva. The company analysed every parliamentary constituency in England, Scotland and Wales to gauge vulnerability to flooding, and shared its findings with the Guardian. In England, 69% of constituencies are likely to see more than a 25% increase in the number of properties at risk by the middle of the century. In Wales and Scotland, every area is projected to experience a similar rise, with many expected to be hit even harder. The threat is particularly acute in densely populated regions such as London, Manchester and parts of north-east England. In Bermondsey and Old Southwark in London, and Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, about 90% of homes could be at risk from river and coastal flooding by 2050 – that is the highest proportions anywhere in the country. “We environment reporters often write about NGOs and campaigners and climate scientists calling for different things, which is great and important. But I was getting wind from a few conversations that the insurance industry was also really concerned about this issue and theirs is a different calculation,” Matthew Taylor told me. He pointed to a quote from Jason Storah, chief executive for UK &amp; Ireland general insurance at Aviva, in his piece to illustrate his point. “He says ‘we’re not in this because we’re climate campaigners or trying to burnish our credentials or because we have a political agenda. This is a hard-headed calculation, we’re looking at the numbers’. And I thought that might have some purchase with a different group of people,” Matthew said. When he and fellow Guardian reporter Helena Horton started making calls to leaders in the industry, it quickly became apparent how widespread the concern was. “It is absolutely a sign that the climate crisis is here and escalating in the UK.” *** Will towns be abandoned? What stood out the most to me in this investigation was a quote from Emma Boyd, the former chair of the Environment Agency, who said it may be too expensive to build the flood protection needed to save some areas. Helena has a fascinating story on what that looks like: in flood-prone Worcestershire, insurers have abandoned the picturesque town of Tenbury Wells, and business owners and residents now fear one more flood could bankrupt the town. “At the moment, there’s this joint government and industry scheme that will protect individual properties, but commercial properties are public buildings and not protected,” said Matthew. “The reality is that some areas at some point will just become too prohibitively expensive to protect and then get flooded too much for them to get insurance – and that is pretty stark.” This scheme, called Flood Re, is due to end in 2039, when climate-related flooding is projected to be more severe. *** What should the government do? For its part, the government says it has drawn up long-term plans to strengthen London’s flood defences over the next century, alongside wider efforts to improve protection across the country, including greater use of natural flood management. On Tuesday, floods minister Emma Hardy announced a £10.5bn investment to protect 900,000 properties in England, alongside new measures designed to speed up the delivery of these defences – which is great, but what I want to know from Matthew is whether it’s all going to be enough. “They are starting to think more holistically about how we manage the changing environment, but it will mean a fairly dramatic change in priorities for planning and development,” said Matthew. But the government’s drive for growth and building 1.5m extra homes by the end of this parliament has raised fears that essential nature and climate considerations will be cast aside. “Within that drive for planning reform, there needs to be an absolute recognition that we need to protect new properties and communities, to make sure [those developments] are all compliant with a changing climate,” he added. *** What can people do? I joke to Matthew that I often describe his patch as the “apocalypse beat.” He was gracious enough to laugh – but I asked whether sometimes things feel hopeless as an environment correspondent. For years, campaigners and experts have warned that something terrible was coming our way. It’s clear now, from the growing flood risks to record-breaking heatwaves, that the future has arrived. Add to that the fact that just this month, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, vowed to take the UK out of net zero commitments that her party once heralded, and that Reform UK, which continues to lead in the polls, has aggressively attacked climate policies across the board and I wonder: doesn’t he feel frightened? Matthew says we don’t have time to be frightened. And we already have all the answers and the technologies we need to address the crisis – we just need the political will. It is important that people feel they have agency, too. He pointed to a recent piece written by Helena outlining how individuals can better defend their homes against flooding. It includes practical steps from sealing doorways togetting rid of your paving (and convincing your neighbours to do the same). And, perhaps most importantly, lobbying the government for better protection. “I do find hope in reporting on the positive things going on at a community and a campaigning level; that when people see an injustice, they come together and make a difference. That, combined with the inescapable truth that the climate crisis is here and that tackling it can improve everyone’s lives, has to be the rallying point for real transformative action.” Now, who is ready to pull up those pavement slabs? What else we’ve been reading Narcissism is one of those terms that gets thrown around as a vague insult – but it refers to something much more specific and complex than mere egotism.

Dan Sabbagh reports Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, is normally a laid-back sort of place. But on Monday night, crowds flooded to the Estádio da Várzea stadium to celebrate a moment that was swiftly compared to the most significant in the country’s footballing history: a 3-0 win over Eswatini. With that result, the island nation of less than 600,000 people became the second-smallest country ever to qualify for the World Cup. The side’s success, which comes 50 years after independence, owes a great deal to members of the large Cape Verdean diaspora, often referred to as the 11th island of the archipelago: 14 of the 25 players called up for the last two qualifying matches are dual nationals. Dailon Rocha Livramento, who was born in the Netherlands, was the team’s top scorer. “Being able to repay the efforts of our grandparents and parents, who emigrated to give us a better future, sometimes even working two jobs at the same time, is the least we can do,” he said. Pleas for a national holiday were denied – but the $10.5m the FCF stands to earn from reaching the World Cup group stage will make a huge difference to the football federation’s finances. Perhaps more important is the sense of national pride. “Independence Day and 13 January 1991 – when the first multiparty elections were held – are the two symbolic dates that have united our people,” said José Maria Silva, the national director of state protocol. “This World Cup qualification can already be considered the third defining moment of our nation.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

commentisfree/2025/nov/04/trump-media-buddies-are-muddling-reality-whole-new-level,Trump and his media buddies are taking the muddling of reality to a whole new level,"You know how I’m going to be able to tell that I’ve really made it as a writer in America? When our very handsome (much better-looking than Zohran Mamdani!) and very high-IQ leader Donald Trump gives me a personal shoutout to commend me on what a wonderful job I’m doing. As we all know, a good journalist should always make the rich and powerful feel comfortable. While I wait for that day to come, I’m watching and learning from the head honchos at CBS. Trump appeared on CBS News’s 60 Minutes on Sunday night for his first sit-down with the show in five years and commented on how much better the network has become after its owner, Paramount, was taken over by his billionaire allies, the father-and-son duo Larry and David Ellison. If you watched the interview on TV, you might have missed that particular bit because (weird!) it didn’t get aired. Nor did the bit where Trump said the network’s new editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, who according to the FT was picked by David Ellison for her pro-Israel views, was a “great new leader”. Nor did a bit where Trump boasted how “60 Minutes paid me a lotta money,” while referencing his $16m settlement from Paramount for what he called a “deceptively” edited interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes in 2024. Also not fully aired on the TV broadcast: a segment in which the president claimed he didn’t know a crypto tycoon who went to prison for breaching money laundering laws, despite the fact that Trump pardoned him. That bit, along with all the others, did appear in the full text transcript published online. Interviews are edited for length and clarity all the time. But the Trump-friendly editing of an interview conducted by a network now owned by the president’s allies, with a head of news that he thinks is “great”, is part of a broader trend of US media outlets lying down and rolling over for Trump. Look, for example, at all the corporate donors that have rushed to show their fealty to Trump by donating to his extravagant ballroom project. These include Amazon, Apple and Meta, as well as Comcast, which is the parent company of NBCUniversal. Look at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post, whose editorial board recently published a defence of Trump’s teardown of the White House’s east wing for his ballroom. “Strong leaders reject calcification,” the editorial board wrote. That’s the same Washington Post, of course, that refused to publish Pulitzer prize winner Ann Telnaes’s cartoon of billionaire Bezos kneeling before Trump. Authoritarians have always sought to control the media. But what’s so terrifying about the current moment isn’t flattering interview edits, it’s the way that Trump and his friends are seeking to edit our relationship with reality. Take Elon Musk, who helped propel Trump to his second term. First Musk bought Twitter – a very convenient way of controlling online discourse – and now he has launched his own AI-powered version of Wikipedia called Grokipedia. “The goal here is to create an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge,” Musk posted on X last week. “Then place copies of that etched in a stable oxide in orbit, the Moon and Mars to preserve it for the future.” Forget stable oxides – the real goal here, you could argue, is instability; to muddy truth and knowledge so thoroughly that reality itself is up for debate. Grokipedia, I’m sure I don’t need to tell you, is already being found to be riddled with factual errors; largely because it pulls from unreliable sources. “Chatroom contributions are given equal status with serious academic work,” one academic told the Guardian. When you make it difficult to separate opinions from facts, it becomes a lot easier to manipulate people. AI-generated videos take the muddling of reality to a whole new level. Fox News, owned by the Murdoch family, recently reported on videos circulating on social media in which Black food stamp beneficiaries were threatening to ransack stores if the US government shutdown stopped their benefits. There were various clues that the videos were AI-generated racist rage-bait, but Fox ignored all those and presented them as real. Eventually it corrected its story to note the videos were AI-generated, but the lie had already travelled halfway around the world. And no doubt Musk’s Grokipedia will soon etch that lie in a stable oxide in orbit, to preserve it for the future. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",social,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/04/trump-media-buddies-are-muddling-reality-whole-new-level,Opinion,2025-11-04T16:55:03Z,2
commentisfree/2025/nov/02/president-jd-vance-marco-rubio-leader-us,President JD Vance or Marco Rubio? We’re seeing the first signs of the battle over Trump’s succession ,"Millions of Americans yearn for 7 November 2028, the scheduled date of the next presidential election. That’s the day the Trump era effectively ends. Probably. That’s the day the Democrats will atone for Kamala Harris’s calamitous 2024 failure. Possibly. That’s the day US democracy is reborn. Hopefully. Succession talk is tantalising Washington. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, has given the clearest sign yet that he’ll run and glossing over past blunders, Harris reckons she deserves a second chance. Yet most attention is focused on the Republicans, after Trump, 79, again threatened to defy the constitution and seek a third term. “I would love to do it,” he said this week. He rowed back later, albeit unconvincingly. “We’ll see what happens,” he teased. This undignified narcissist’s electoral fan dance will drag on interminably. Of greater practical interest are the two names Trump picked out as his most likely successors: JD Vance and Marco Rubio, vice-president and secretary of state respectively. Trump predicted a two-horse race for the 2028 Republican nomination – although his favourites frequently fall, as Mike Pence, Rex Tillerson, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton and many others can testify. Nor are Trump’s opinions much shared beyond his base. Vance and Rubio have already shown themselves to be unsuited to high office. Yet as matters stand, the possibility one of these mediocre chancers will assume Maga’s mantle and seize the crown must be taken seriously. It’s a choice between a pit bull and a poodle. Aggressive, noisy, nasty and occasionally jaw-droppingly ignorant, JD Vance, 41, is the bro to beat, the heir apparent and dauphin to King Don. He leads by huge margins in early polling in Republican primary states. His language is vulgar, his views simplistic. When it was suggested the US’s extrajudicial killing of alleged drug smugglers could be a war crime, he wrote on X: “I don’t give a shit what you call it.” Charming. Vance habitually weaponises social media to defend Trump and vilify “crazy leftwing radicals”. In one notorious exchange, he tried to excuse racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments about “monkeys”, Hitler and rape made in a Republican online chat group. Challenged over a cruelly offensive AI video targeting a black Democrat congressman that was reposted by Trump, Vance said: “I think it’s funny. The president’s joking and we’re having a good time.” In contrast, following the murder of his hard-right ally, Charlie Kirk, Vance demanded a nationwide crackdown on “far-left” dissent – meaning views he disliked. This display of double standards echoed his pitiful overseas debut in Munich in February, when he hypocritically lectured Europe on freedom and censorship while courting Germany’s far-right leader, Alice Weidel. Vance subsequently confirmed his reputation as a muddled, unmuzzled attack dog by savaging Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who knows more about defending liberty than he ever will. If Vance does run, he will have to spell out what he believes. The problem is, he doesn’t know. He once dismissed Trump as an “idiot” he would “never” support. As an Ohio senator, he opposed foreign wars; as vice-president, he has backed unilateral attacks on Iran, Yemen and Venezuela. In his self-indulgent, self-promoting book, Hillbilly Elegy, he criticised white working-class communities for blaming their problems on China, migrants and “woke” elites. Now he himself does exactly that, all the time. Rubio is an altogether quieter, strangely passive figure and possibly the most ineffectual secretary of state of recent times. While Trump runs the show and hogs the limelight on Israel, Ukraine and China, Rubio, 54, acts as prop, cheerleader and repairman. His job: to make sense of Trump’s ill-considered, hyped-up deals – an impossible task at which he fails daily. His dangerous tardiness in implementing security elements of the Gaza “peace plan” is a case in point. Rubio wasn’t always so feeble. As a 2016 presidential candidate, competing against Trump (who ridiculed him as “Little Marco”), he championed traditional US alliances, human rights and foreign aid. Referencing Russia, he condemned efforts “by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbours”. Yet since he took the Trump shilling, his principled stands have mysteriously eroded. US overseas assistance budgets have been gutted, democracy promotion and human rights deprioritised, and direct US support for Ukraine eviscerated. His tenure as secretary of state was initially overshadowed by Elon Musk, who slashed state department jobs and soft power programmes while Rubio looked away; and more recently by Steve Witkoff, the Trump crony dubbed “envoy for everything”. Yet in one policy area, this son of anti-Castro migrants is consistent: his antipathy to leftwing regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. In his other role as national security adviser, Rubio leads the increasingly militarised charge to topple Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship in Caracas. Justifying lethal maritime attacks on suspected drug smugglers from Venezuela and Colombia, Rubio declared in September that lawful interdiction didn’t work. “What will stop them is when you blow them up... And it’ll happen again,” he warned. Which it has, repeatedly. Rubio plays front man, too, for Trump’s crude pressure campaigns against Panama, Brazil and Mexico, mass deportations of migrants to prisons run by El Salvador’s repressive regime, and overall attempt to reduce Latin America once again to a semi-colonised US backyard. While all this may win Rubio support on the right, it risks alienating independent voters. His behaviour only makes sense if he, like Vance, plans to run for president as a second-generation Maga mini-me. Both these ever-malleable Trump chumps look set to do precisely that in 2028. Like their boss, they know nothing of statesmanship or a higher calling. Followers not leaders, they are united in unbridled ambition – and unfitness to rule. Surely the US can do better than this. Oops! That’s what they said about Trump in 2016.

world/2025/oct/29/favela-reeling-rio-deadliest-police-raid-brazil,"‘This was a slaughter, not an operation’: the favela reeling from Rio’s deadliest police raid","Day had yet to break over Vila Cruzeiro but already dozens of corpses were splayed out along the favela’s main drag after more than 130 people were killed during the deadliest police operation in Rio’s history: grotesquely disfigured, blood-smeared bodies that had been dragged out of nearby forests and dumped on blue tarpaulins and black plastic sheets covering the street. “I’ve brought 53 down myself … there must be another 12 or 15 up there in the bush,” said Erivelton Vidal Correia, the head of the local residents’ association, bleary-eyed from a sleepless night spent hauling bullet-riddled local men down from the hills. Correia broke down as he described his relentless nocturnal hunt for the dead after Rio suffered what is being called one of the biggest police massacres in modern Brazilian history. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life, brother – not even in the Gaza Strip does this happen … I can’t bear to see any more corpses,” he wept, covering his face with the surgical gloves he was using to handle the deceased. Rio officials said on Tuesday that at least 64 people, including four police officers, had been killed after a force of 2,500 launched a pre-dawn assault on Alemão and Penha, the vast patchwork of favelas of which Vila Cruzeiro is part. By the early hours of Wednesday the public prosecutor said the death toll had risen to 132 – higher than during São Paulo’s notorious Carandiru prison massacre in 1992, when 111 prisoners lost their lives. Between 4.15am and 9am, when government body collectors finally arrived, the Guardian witnessed pickup trucks delivering dozens of corpses to a square in Vila Cruzeiro named after Saint Luke the Evangelist. “I’ve never seen anything like this … I still haven’t managed to comprehend what has happened. I feel empty. I have no words,” said Raull Santiago, a favela activist, as another cargo of corpses arrived, sending local women scrambling in search of their missing husbands, brothers or sons. Many, perhaps all of the dead men – most seemingly in their late teens, 20s and 30s – are likely to have been members of the local drug faction, the Red Command, which Tuesday’s operation was intended to target. Most of the corpses were unclothed but a few wore ghillie suits, camouflage clothing used by snipers, hunters and nature photographers to conceal themselves in foliage. But there was fury among the scores of people who had flocked to the plaza and who claimed police had summarily executed the young men instead of detaining them. “Irrespective of whether these people were involved in the local drug trade or not, we don’t have the death penalty in Brazil … They should have been arrested,” Santiago said. “Murderers! Murderers!” cried Elieci Santana, 58, recalling how her son, Fábio, had messaged her at about 3pm on Tuesday to tell her he had been shot in the foot and was trying to surrender to police. Sixteen hours later, Fábio’s corpse was shrouded under a blood-stained floral rug with what looked like knife wounds to his chest. “My God! Work a miracle, God!” Santana begged, as she collapsed on to the ground beside her child. But there was to be no resurrection for Santana’s son, nor for the dozens of other bodies lined up beside him outside a sushi restaurant with bullet wounds to their limbs, torsos and heads. One had been decapitated, the person’s head stashed inside an olive green pouch that was placed on the ground. Several of the men had badly broken bones or what looked like puncture wounds in their flesh. At times, as pickup trucks continued to deliver the dead, a stunned silence fell over the throng. No one – not the veteran crime reporters, nor the gangland preachers, nor the battle-weary favela residents – had ever seen bloodshed on this scale. Until this week, Rio’s deadliest police operation had been a 2021 raid on another Red Command stronghold, Jacarezinho, when 28 people were killed. “It’s surreal,” said Antônio Carlos Costa, a church leader and human rights campaigner, calling for the immediate removal of Rio’s governor, Cláudio Castro, who is an ally of Brazil’s former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Costa called the killings “a historic humiliation” for Brazil on the eve of next month’s Cop climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém. At other moments, onlookers exploded in rage as they took in the nightmarish scene. Shell-shocked friends and relatives of the deceased ripped off the sheets covering their mangled bodies and demanded that journalists film the butchery to show the world. “Help us, please!” implored Cláudia Silva, 53, shaking with rage as she denounced what she and others called “a genocide”. “When they come in here, they kill even the rats,” she said of the police. “This was a slaughter, not an operation. They came here to kill,” said Santana as she sat on a blood-covered bin liner next to her son’s corpse. “In 30 years working [in the favelas] this is the greatest act of savagery, the biggest massacre I have seen,” said Flávia Pinheiro Fróes, a lawyer who had come to support the families of the dead. Castro continued to defend the operation amid a growing chorus of outrage, including from the UN’s human rights office which said it was horrified by the killings. Rio’s governor celebrated “a harsh blow” to the heavily-armed drug traffickers who have seized control of many of Rio’s hundreds of favelas over the past 40 years. “The only victims yesterday were the police,” Castro said of the four officers killed during Tuesday’s intense gun battles with criminals he called “narco-terrorists”. As the governor spoke, Edmar Augusto, a priest with a purple stole draped over his shoulders, sprinkled holy water on the more than 50 bodies that had accumulated at the entrance to the favela. “We don’t want war. We want peace,” Augusto, 50, told the favela’s mourners, his voice breaking with emotion. “So many families are crying. And I want to cry with them. Society cannot stay silent,” the priest bellowed, staring skywards to recite the Lord’s prayer. As he waited for another car-load of bodies to arrive, Correia, the community leader, recalled how two decades earlier a group of local evangelical missionaries had warned that the favela would one day suffer a momentous bloodbath. “We didn’t believe them. We never believed it would happen,” he said. “[But] they prophesised this, and today it has come to pass.”",social,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/favela-reeling-rio-deadliest-police-raid-brazil,World news,2025-10-29T18:55:31Z,2
