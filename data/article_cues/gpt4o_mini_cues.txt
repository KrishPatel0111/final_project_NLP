38. [quote | statement] this is a party not afraid to say migration has helped make this country what we are today
39. [quote | statement] I do want to spend a moment to mark yesterday’s awful attack
40. [quote | statement] I feel this deeply and my heart is with the community
41. [quote | statement] One brought up Jewish. One raised Muslim. One a child of the church.
42. [quote | statement] Everything we do between now and the next election must be bold
43. [quote | statement] Labour’s arrogant assumptions that it is entitled to people’s vote ends today
44. [quote | statement] More of the same from Keir Starmer won’t just fail us now, it will hand this country on a plate to the dark forces around Nigel Farage

56. [quote | statement] Its politics is one of managed decline dressed up as national renewal
57. [quote | statement] draped in Reform-bating policymaking
58. [quote | statement] The arrival of the media-savvy Polanski
59. [quote | statement] has brought the Greens new members and extra attention
