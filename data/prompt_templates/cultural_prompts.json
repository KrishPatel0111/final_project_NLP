    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: ‘Dictator-for-life vibes’: our architecture critic on Trump’s bulletproof ballroom bling\nDOMAIN: Cultural\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nAs if truffling thuggishly in pursuit of the Nobel peace prize wasn’t enough, the spectacle of bulldozers ripping into the White House is yet more evidence of Donald Trump’s unstinting quest for epic self-aggrandisement. Having decreed the East Wing not fit for purpose – namely, his purposes of swank and show – he plans to replace it with a faux classical bulletproof ballroom, capable of seating up to 650 partygoers. Renderings show a vast, glacially white aircraft hangar of a structure embellished with an ornate coffered ceiling, gilded Corinthian columns and drooping gold chandeliers. Nero, who conceived the original domus aurea, would feel right at home. Costing $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will. On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden. So, having been here before, the American Institute of Architects is wearily wary, stating: “AIA is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities, mandate official federal design preferences, or otherwise hinder design freedom, and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings.” White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing, Richard Nixon installed a bowling lane and Harry S Truman commissioned an entire reconstruction. Several first ladies have revamped the decor and furnishings, notably Jackie Kennedy, whose soigné interiors were designed to connect the presidential home more resonantly with American history. The now doomed East Wing, dating from 1902, has been a much-changed addition. Intermittently housing the office of the first lady, what’s left of it sits above the presidential emergency operations centre, a high security bunker built during the second world war. Vice-president Dick Cheney and his retinue retreated there during the 9/11 attacks, as did Trump at the start of the George Floyd protests in 2020. The man who landed the ballroom job is James McCrery, founder of Washington-based McCrery Architects and a trenchant advocate of classical architecture. “Americans love classical architecture,” he has said, “because it is our formative architecture – and we love our nation’s formation.” Ironically, McCrery began his career working for Peter Eisenman, the high priest of deconstructivism, before a conversion of Damascene proportions prompted him to renounce the avant garde and “rethink his modernist education”. \n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nCosting $250m (£187.5m), a sum to be extracted from sycophantic donors, Trump’s ballroom is one of the most grandiose White House projects to be implemented in more than a century, as he strives to bend the building – and US architecture more generally – to his will. White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling. His more recent engoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared to a professional wrestler’s dressing room. “It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.” On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs. A similarly prescriptive order was enacted during Trump’s first spell in office, only to be rescinded by Joe Biden. Specialising in the design of “traditional” Catholic churches, McCrery was appointed by Trump during his first term to serve on the US Commission of Fine Arts, an independent federal agency with the power to review the “design and aesthetics” of all construction within Washington DC.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 8,\n

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Bob Vylan ‘not regretful’ about IDF chant at Glastonbury: ‘I’d do it again tomorrow’\nDOMAIN: Cultural\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nBob Vylan frontman Bobby Vylan is “not regretful” of his “death, death to the IDF” chant at Glastonbury and said he would “do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays”. The outspoken punk duo sparked controversy when they led chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, at the festival in June. The chant was condemned by Glastonbury and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described it as “appalling hate speech”. Bob Vylan was dropped by its agency UTA, and the US state department revoked the member’s visas, forcing them to cancel a North American tour. Speaking on The Louis Theroux Podcast in his first interview since Glastonbury, Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, was asked if he would do it all again. He replied: “Oh yeah. Like what if I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes I would do it again. I’m not regretful of it. I’d do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays. He said the backlash the band had faced was “minimal compared to what people in Palestine are going through”. “I don’t want to overstate the importance of the chant,” he added. “That’s not what I’m trying to do, but if I have their support, they’re the people that I’m doing it for, they’re the people that I’m being vocal for, then what is there to regret? Oh, because I’ve upset some rightwing politician or some rightwing media?” Vylan’s conversation with Theroux was recorded on 1 October. At the start of the episode, the presenter states that it took place before the Manchester synagogue attacks on 2 October, in which two people were killed and three others injured, and before the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on 10 October. The musician said he was taken aback by the uproar sparked by the chant, and claimed members of BBC staff at Glastonbury told him on the day that the set was “fantastic”. The corporation’s executive complaints unit (ECU) has since found the BBC’s broadcast of the performance breached editorial standards in relation to harm and offence. Vylan told Theroux there was no sign of a controversy in the moment: “It wasn’t like we came off stage, and everybody was like [gasps]. It’s just normal. We come off stage. It’s normal. Nobody thought anything. Nobody. Even staff at the BBC were like ‘That was fantastic! We loved that!’” Vylan also hit back at Damon Albarn from Blur, who called the chant “one of the most spectacular misfires I’ve seen in my life” and described Vylan as “goose-stepping in tennis gear”. Albarn’s reaction was “disappointing” and “lacked self-awareness”, Vylan said. “I just want to say that categorising it as a ‘spectacular misfire’ implies that somehow the politics of the band or our stance on Palestinian liberation is not thought out,” he said. “I take great issue with the phrase ‘goose-stepping’ being used because it’s only used around Nazi Germany,” he added. “That’s it. And for him to use that language, I think is disgusting. I think his response was disgusting.” Asked what he meant by the c\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nBob Vylan frontman Bobby Vylan is “not regretful” of his “death, death to the IDF” chant at Glastonbury and said he would “do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays”. Asked what he meant by the chant “Death to the IDF,” Vylan said the chant itself was “unimportant”. The outspoken punk duo sparked controversy when they led chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, at the festival in June. When Vylan said he thought the band had been criticised more heavily than others for speaking about the conflict, Theroux mentioned the Irish band Kneecap, who have also faced backlash for their approach to pro-Palestine messaging. If there were large numbers of people going out and going like ‘Bob Vylan made me do this’. Speaking on The Louis Theroux Podcast in his first interview since Glastonbury, Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, was asked if he would do it all again. Vylan also rejected claims from the Community Security Trust (CST), a monitoring and Jewish community safety organisation, that their set contributed to a spike in antisemitic incidents reported two days later.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 9,\n  \"domain\": \"Cultural\",\n  \"title\": \"Bob Vylan ‘not regretful’ about IDF

Stephen Colbert “At this point, we’re nine months into this, you’d think it would be impossible for us to be shocked by Donald Trump,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. “But give the man credit – every so often, he takes the time to attach the electrodes to our nipples. And then it feels like the first time.” Case in point: on Monday, as part of his White House renovation project to construct a gilded ballroom, Trump sent out a backhoe to rip off a part of the East Wing. “That is it, we are not giving him the security deposit back,” Colbert quipped. “That is so deeply unsettling,” he continued. “It’s like being a kid and seeing your teacher at the grocery store … for sale … in the meat department. “We’re just nine months into Trump’s term, and he’s already going ‘Hulk smash’ on the White House. Last time, it took at least four years to bring a demo crew to the Capitol,” he added, referring to January 6. The demolition comes after Trump promised that the $250m, 90,000-sq-ft ballroom renovation would not touch the existing White House. “So that was a lie,” said Colbert. “At this point, should we even believe that this is going to end up being a ballroom? It could just as easily end up being a combination Pizza Hut-Taco Bell!” The treasury department has even instructed its employees not to share any photos of the White House “construction”. “Not generally something you instruct when you’re proud of what’s going on,” Colbert noted. “Hey guys, remember, no photos at my wedding … and it’s not because I’m marrying a body pillow of Mariah Carey.’” The Daily Show “The government shutdown is now in its third week,” said Michael Kosta on the Daily Show. “Countless federal employees aren’t being paid. Food stamps will run out soon. And there’s no end in sight. But not to worry – President Trump is working day and night … to build a ballroom! “It’s exactly what you voted for, coalminers in Pennsylvania: 90,000 gilded sq ft for Trump to do the jerk-off dance in,” he joked. “But if you’re worried such a renovation might damage the people’s house, let Donald Trump put your fears to rest.” Trump claimed that the project would “not interfere with the current building” because it would be “near it but not touching it” and “paying total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of, it’s my favorite” “Yeah, it’s my favorite. I never want to leave … and I’m never going to,” Kosta mocked. “I believe it’s his favorite building, though. He loves the history, the decor, the immunity from criminal convictions it provides. But great! The White House itself is going to be fine.” Until a backhoe tore down some of the East Wing facade. “Well, it looks like they touched it,” Kosta joked. “I mean, holy shit, who’s his general contractor? Bin Laden and Sons?” “Apparently ‘not touching’ the White House turned into ‘\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nCase in point: on Monday, as part of his White House renovation project to construct a gilded ballroom, Trump sent out a backhoe to rip off a part of the East Wing. In other news, during a White House press conference on Monday, Trump claimed that a cameraman hit a mirror with a piece of equipment.

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: ‘A palette unlike anything in the west’: Ben Okri, Yinka Shonibare and more on how Nigerian art revived Britain’s cultural landscape\nDOMAIN: Cultural\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nSome primal energy was unleashed among Nigerian artists in the years leading up to independence. The century-long reign of colonialism was nearing its end and the people of Nigeria, with its over 300 tribes, its ebullient energy, were poised for a new future in which they would determine the shape and context of their lives. And the people who most articulated that double position, that paradox of modernity and tradition, were artists in all their stripes. Artists across the country, in constant dialogue with one another, created works that evoked their traditions but in a contemporary context. Artists such as Yusuf Grillo in the north, Bruce Onobrakpeya from the midwest, Ben Enwonwu from the east and Twins Seven Seven from the west were remaking the dream of art in a rigorously Nigerian context. The effect of the works created by the Zaria Art Society, the generation that congregated in Lagos and exhibited all over the world, was profound. Their work helped the nation to reconnect with its ancient ways, but adapted to modern times. It was a new art, brooding and celebratory. Often it was an art that hinted at the many dimensions of Nigerian mythology; often it drew upon daily realities. Spirits, ancestral presences, rituals, masquerades featured prominently, alongside popular subjects of dancing figures, portraits and landscapes, but rendered in a unique light, with a palette that was utterly unlike anything in the western tradition. It is important to stress that these were not artists creating in isolation. They were in touch with the currents of world art, as can be seen by the responses to cubism in many works of sculpture. It was not a response as such but a taking back, a retrieval, of what cubism took from Africa. The other area in which this Nigerian modernism revealed itself is in the Nigerian novel. Works such as Chinua Achebe’s seminal Things Fall Apart, Wole Soyinka’s The Interpreters and Amos Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard are all works that depict a nation fermenting with energy and cultural tensions. Christopher Okigbo wrote in Labyrinths, 1967, that “We carry in our worlds that flourish / Our worlds that have failed.” But the opposite is also true. We carry in our worlds that have failed, our worlds that flourish. Two important contemporary events bear this out. The much-awaited opening of the art museum in the ancient city of Benin, MOWAA (Museum of West African Art), may be the single most important event in African art since the infamous burning of African works of art by the British in that same city, in 1897. The other is the Tate Modern in London’s upcoming exhibition, Nigerian Modernism, which aims to spotlight Nigeria’s contribution to the wider story of modern art and British culture. Nigerian writers and artists in Britain have been a vital part of that story, not least Ben Enwonwu, who sojourned here during the Nigerian civil war and sculpted Queen Elizabeth II in the 50s. For almost 100 years, figures such as Uzo Eg\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nA turning point in the recognition of Nigerian modernism came in 2018, when Enwonwu’s portrait Tutu sold at Bonhams for £1.2m. Suddenly, Nigerian art was being taken seriously by the global art market. Some primal energy was unleashed among Nigerian artists in the years leading up to independence. This exhibition centres Nigerian artists on their own terms. It was only when I lived in Lagos in the early 2000s that I saw the incredible range of Nigerian artists. Nigerian artists such as Wizkid, and British-Nigerian musicians such as Tinie Tempah and Dave, bring an energy and confidence that I try to bring to my writing. If I had to choose one piece of Nigerian art which has affected me the most, it would be Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It was powerful, uplifting and deeply connected to Nigerian identity, and left a lasting impression on me, even as a child.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: A drag queen stands at a site of violence: Lee-Ann Olwage’s best photograph\nDOMAIN: Cultural\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nI have always been interested in gender and identity stories. In South Africa, we have a strong liberal constitution on paper for queer rights, but the reality on the streets – the hate crimes, the animosity in the workplace and in social settings – is very different. I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. That led me to the drag pageant scene. I would go to photograph pageants every weekend, and every Monday I would get messages from the people I’d photographed asking me to send the pictures – so I had a lot of instant feedback on the work I was making. I was using harsh lighting to play with the idea of masculine and feminine, to emphasise the contrast between the strong jawlines and the feminine personae. But there’s no one more honest than a drag queen, and very early on, someone told me they really didn’t like the picture I’d taken of them. It was hard to hear, but letting go of my ego I asked this person why. They said it was because they didn’t look beautiful. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. I changed my approach. And if I hadn’t had that knock to my ego, the work wouldn’t have become what it needed to be. Over the next year and a half, making the work became a conversation with the drag queens. I put it out there that I wanted to do a collaborative project. Belinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. The idea was to work with other drag artists and visit places where acts of violence had happened, and to reclaim these places. I told Belinda to think about who should tell this story – I wanted her to consider carefully if I was the right person. Two weeks later, she came back and said she wanted to work with me. I was concerned for the drag queens’ safety, not only while going to these sites of violence and making the images but also after, as some of them lived in the townships where the portraits would be made. I sat with it for a while. But one thing Belinda said stuck with me. She said: “If we don’t go, if we don’t reclaim these spaces and make these pictures, then it’s like we don’t exist.” The entire series was shot in four hours. We met at a petrol station on the day, so the drag queens could get ready – everyone had specific ideas about what they wanted to wear. We moved quickly and didn’t linger. I was definitely nervous – it made me realise how these people feel every day, you can never fully relax. I photographed Belinda at the shisanyama – a community space where women cook and sell meat – in Khayelitsha, a township located on the Cape Flats, near Cape Town. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was the end of the day and the light w\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nBelinda, who is in this image, came to me and told me she was applying for the Miss Drag South Africa pageant; part of the competition involves doing a project. This image is part of the World Press Photo print sale, 17-26 November, in celebration of World Press Photo at 70 I was curious about where people could go not only to feel safe but to feel celebrated for who they are, and feel truly embraced. I realised it was the harsh lighting – how a photographer sees and thinks a story should be told is often not the way people see themselves, or how they want to be shown. It’s the heart of the township, a gathering point with people cooking meat on open fires. It was a small gathering but people were really engaged, and came to ask questions, and the artists shared about themselves. It wasn’t so much the award but the fact that people celebrated a story I loved and my way of seeing the world.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n

He was claiming the prize for Clash of the Comics, the bombastic night that throws comedians and pro wrestlers into the ring, when Ed Gamble stormed in, knocked everyone out, and swanned off with the belt. “Well,” corrects the comedian and Clash co-founder Max Olesker, “we were knocked down by his henchman.” Hulking pro wrestler Bullit was the one to clothesline him and his comedy partner, Ivan Gonzalez. “I think I could have taken Ed if he’d been on his own,” huffs Olesker. The popularity of pro wrestling has fluctuated since its golden era in the 1980s. At the start of this year, WWE made the leap on to Netflix with an eye-watering $5bn (£4bn) deal, inching the skimpily clad, heavily muscled combat sport higher in the public consciousness. In Britain, it has a rich working-class history, growing from the grassroots to raising some of the greatest international contenders such as Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr. Now, wrestling is dipping a greased-up toe into the theatrical limelight, with a smattering of productions across the UK welcoming new audiences through alternative performance lenses, from comedy to queer cabaret to a living sculpture that uses bondage to suspend disbelief. Olesker, who used to be the UK’s youngest pro wrestler as Max Voltage, was the one to introduce Gonzalez to wrestling, putting on a match in the student union at university. “The atmosphere was electric,” Gonzalez remembers. “It’s this larger-than-life pantomime: good versus evil.” Forming a comedy duo together as Max &amp; Ivan, the pair decided to blend the art forms for a show at the Edinburgh fringe, convincing pro wrestlers that they weren’t making fun of them and persuading comedians to throw themselves off the ropes. The Wrestling, as it was then called, won the Edinburgh comedy award and has rocketed in popularity since. Renamed Clash of the Comics, the brutal showdown that saw Rosie Jones defeat Greg Davies at the O2, as part of the 2023 Just for Laughs festival, is about to take over the Hammersmith Apollo, west London, where for the first time it will stand outside a wider comedy festival. The lineup includes pro wrestlers Simon Miller, Cara Noir and La Cyclonica, with comedians Aisling Bea, Flo &amp; Joan and James Acaster, who has issued an open challenge to any comedian or wrestler willing to take him on. And, naturally, Wang needs to win his championship belt back from Gamble. Commentating from the sidelines, Nish Kumar will be cheering for the rule-breaking baddies, Sara Pascoe will support the good and righteous, and Greg James will give an impartial play-by-play. Comedy is key to the night, but the show’s success relies on the spectacles in the ring. “They’re both performance art,” Olesker considers. “You travel the world, you react to an audience. It’s a real meeting of disciplines.” Logistically, the event is a nightmare.

He was claiming the prize for Clash of the Comics, the bombastic night that throws comedians and pro wrestlers into the ring, when Ed Gamble stormed in, knocked everyone out, and swanned off with the belt. Forming a comedy duo together as Max &amp; Ivan, the pair decided to blend the art forms for a show at the Edinburgh fringe, convincing pro wrestlers that they weren’t making fun of them and persuading comedians to throw themselves off the ropes. Melding queer performance and pro wrestling, the night features back-flipping drag kings, anarchic performances from pro wrestlers and an openness to the types of bodies that tend to be excluded from the mainstream. The lineup includes pro wrestlers Simon Miller, Cara Noir and La Cyclonica, with comedians Aisling Bea, Flo &amp; Joan and James Acaster, who has issued an open challenge to any comedian or wrestler willing to take him on. Now, wrestling is dipping a greased-up toe into the theatrical limelight, with a smattering of productions across the UK welcoming new audiences through alternative performance lenses, from comedy to queer cabaret to a living sculpture that uses bondage to suspend disbelief. The popularity of pro wrestling has fluctuated since its golden era in the 1980s.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 13,\n  \"domain\":

Ellis Park Out now Musician and composer Warren Ellis is known for his collaborations with Nick Cave in bands and on film scores, but this film, the first documentary from film-maker Justin Kurzel (Snowtown, Nitram) focuses on a Cave-free passion project: a wildlife sanctuary in the forests of Sumatra co-founded by Ellis. Visions of Ukraine Barbican, London, 29 September to 2 October Ranging from the silent cinema era to modern movie-making, this short season at the Barbican of Ukrainian film includes Mikhail Kaufman’s In Spring (1929), and the UK premiere of new archival documentary Fragments of Ice (2024), as well as short films dedicated to the Ukrainian queer community during the current war. The Strangers: Chapter 2 Out now Don’t be fooled by “Chapter 2” – this is in fact the fourth film in the Strangers home-invasion horror franchise, which claims to be based on a true story but, erm, isn’t – unless “some murders happen in a house” is close enough. Renny Harlin (Deep Blue Sea) directs the stabbing and slashing.

Trumpet virtuoso Piotr Wojtasik with vocalist-pianist Anna Maria Jopek (27 September), and UK-based vocalist-violinist Alice Zawadzki and singer Aga Zaryan (28 September; the latter the first Polish artist to record for Blue Note), are among the highlights. John Fordham Celebrating Shostakovich Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, 3 October The BBC National Orchestra of Wales marks the 50th anniversary of the death of Shostakovich with a performance of his most massive symphony, No 7 in C, the Leningrad. Ryan Bancroft conducts, and prefaces it with Shostakovich’s first violin concerto. Andrew Clements The Magnetic Fields 26 September to 6 October; tour starts Bristol Released in 1999, the Magnetic Fields’ sixth album 69 Love Songs has rightly taken up classic status. Packed full of pin-sharp vignettes couched in country, synthpop, folk and jazz, it will be played in full across two nights, in three cities.
