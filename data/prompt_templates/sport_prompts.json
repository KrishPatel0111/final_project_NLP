There is, she argues, plenty of real and justified guilt in the world, without co-opting it to our choice of trash TV or an unkickable penchant for romantasy novels. She’s a helpful touchstone when I hear myself trying to justify the silly superhero film I went to see at the cinema on the basis that it might have carried an underlying anti-fascist message (if you squinted hard enough at the screen). My friend will sigh kindly and then remind me: sometimes it’s OK just to enjoy things. It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer. Ask a football fan if they enjoyed themselves at the match they just paid a decent whack to see, and there’s a better-than-even chance they will tell you no. If it was a close match, they will have been too anxious to have fun; if they lost they will be mourning their defeat. Even if their own side ran rampant, you can find them complaining about the lack of challenge or jeopardy. We are, as fans, especially averse to one-sided games, which can feel anything from a deflationary disappointment to a waste of everybody’s time. This is why the current Women’s Rugby World Cup is such a curious phenomenon. The tournament has been one of largely lopsided scorelines, from the group stages to the quarter-finals. Only five of the 28 fixtures have been decided by fewer than 14 points, and more than half were won by more than 40 – at least six scores. And yet there remains a profound and unanimous pleasure to be had across the entire affair: it’s hard to find anyone that’s watching along and not enjoying it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). Meanwhile the action on the pitch has delivered flair and fascination, even on days when the rain has lashed down until the ball is butter and the scrums steam like suet pudding. The match-ups may be uneven but the power and athleticism on display on all sides of the pitch have been mesmerising. Sure, the host nation’s dominance is a natural mood enhancer. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. That’s only part of the picture, however. It doesn’t encompass the joyful embrace of The Kid, New Zealand’s 18-year-old top try-scorer Braxton Sorensen-McGee (whose daring dashes down the wing could well knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles if the two sides meet). It can’t account for the bipartisan cheer when Spain, 54-3 d\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nTheir fast-growing fanbase, many of whom have only discovered the sport in the past couple of years, do not show up to games with the typical baggage: decades of disappointment, crusted-over anger, inherited and inexplicably toxic rivalries. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. Other sports – and more pertinently their investors – will be analysing this fan engagement and wondering how to replicate it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. It is, of course, a marketing tactic as much as a rallying cry, but it came directly from team conversations and reflects something quite true about the women’s rugby community, that is a place where people are for each other, not against them. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 17,\n  \"domain\": \"Sport\",\n  \"title\": \"Freedom and joy: Rugby World Cup’s quirky quality sets it apart from the pack\",\n  \"tables\": [\n    {\n      \"header\": [\n        \"Cue Type\",\n        \"Subtype\",\n        \"Text Span\",\n        \"Preserved in Summary?\"\n      ],\n      \"rows\": [\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“guilty pleasures”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“kickable penchant”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“if you squinted hard enough”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“just to enjoy things”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes (“just enjoy…”)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“paid a decent whack”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“ran rampant”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“waste of everybody’s time”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“come-as-you-are quality”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“forcing or faking it”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“for one brass farthing”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“for the girls” (slogan)\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Ruby Tui\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Braxton Sorensen-McGee\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Maro Itoje\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Ilona Maher\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Aseza Hele\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Abby Dow\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Anne-Marie\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Ellie Kildunne\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes (appears indirectly in summary?

It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity and turning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination. But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician – any politician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval. According to internal emails obtained by outlets including PA and Bounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.) This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protester gluing himself to a seat for nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind its US Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation. And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy. Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa May was booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macron was whistled during the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is all but guaranteed a chorus of boos during public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next to the venom res\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nIt platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion. Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience?\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 18,\n  \"domain\": \"Sport\",\n  \"title\": \"The USTA’s
