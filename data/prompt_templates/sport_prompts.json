    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Former West Coast player Mitch Brown becomes first AFL player to come out as bisexual\nDOMAIN: Sport\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nMitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen. The 36-year-old played 94 matches for West Coast in a career that ended in 2016. He identifies as a bisexual man and is in a long-term relationship with a woman. Brown said it would have been difficult had he spoken publicly during his playing career, but was motivated to help change the culture within the sport. “Maybe a second person [comes out], and then the third…,” he told The Daily Aus. “You may be playing with someone who’s in the queer community. Empathy is powerful.” Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. But suspensions have been unable to address the root causes of the game’s struggle to accept diversity among its players. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown said. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter The news was widely welcomed on social media. In addition to messages from fans and supporters, the AFL Players’ Association described the post as “powerful” and the GWS Giants’ account responded with a heart emoji. Pride Cup CEO Hayley Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+ communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “To be honest, I did not think I would ever see the day when either an ex or current AFL men’s player would come out,” she said. “I felt like we were so far away from this, which is really, really exciting, that someone has done it. It shouldn’t take courage to tell the world who you are, but it is extremely courageous from Mitch. “In the light of what the community went through last week, I thought that it’s even more brave that he decided to do it around this time and to speak up about his experiences.” Brown grew up in Ballarat and was drafted into the AFL with pick 16 in 2006. The defender debuted the following year and spent a decade in the competition before playing his final game at age 27, an elimination final against the Western Bulldogs. “I got to the end of my career and I was asked to play on for a couple more years, and I was over it. I was done,” he said. “I craved talking to someone and not being judged. I craved the ability to choose who I wanted to be around, rather than to fit into a team.” He said he had “buried” questions about his own sexuality due to the “hyper-masculine” environment, and that slurs were so constant they “just became part of the normal conversation”. “There have been so many times in my life I’ve seen things or heard things and not said anything … in fear of people thinking I was gay or bisexual.” Brown said he empathises with those currently playing, and it is easier for him as a past player to speak up. “I don’t have to \n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nPride Cup CEO Hayley Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+ communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “I’m hopeful this could mean that Mitch’s story might have a bigger impact than other players who’ve come out, because he’s a respected AFL player, an insider, talking about the problems in the game. Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown said. AFL CEO Andrew Dillon acknowledged Brown’s courage in sharing his story and how important the moment was for the game. Mitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen. We haven’t heard that kind of direct criticism before from other players who have come out, including in rugby union and also football in Australia, and so this is an important turning point.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 2,\n  \"domain\": \"Sport\",\n  \"title\": \"Former West Coast player Mitch Brown becomes

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: The NHL preached inclusion. So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?\nDOMAIN: Sport\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\n“Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far – diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued. Last week, Bettman was named alongside NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk and various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports council. The council will be responsible for – among other things – playing an “important role in restoring tradition to college athletics, including … keeping men out of women’s sports.” Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it. This is not the first time Bettman has given mixed messages around social issues. In 2023, for example, the NHL tried to host a career fair aimed at recruiting a more diverse workforce (its inclusivity report noted that the league’s employees were roughly 84% white and 93% straight). The event, attached to that year’s All Star Game in Florida, quickly caught the attention of the governor’s office, which accused the NHL of discrimination – against white people. The league cancelled the career fair. A few weeks later, the NHL again had the opportunity to stand for its diversity values when a handful of players refused to wear their team’s Pride-themed warmup jerseys. Instead, the NHL retreated meekly, encouraging “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues.” That June – Pride month, no less – Bettman cancelled the Pride jerseys altogether, calling the furor around them “a distraction” from the intended message. One wonders what he will call his own foray directly into the culture wars or, for that matter, how the NHL may characterize this particular moment of self-expression from the commissioner. It’s likely that Bettman’s participation in Trump’s sports council will fall into the “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues” category the league talked about during the Pride jerseys fiasco. But seeing as Trump seems fixated on getting trans women out of college sports – even though there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes in college sports, according to the president of the NCAA – this feels like a very specific kind of perspective on a cultural issue, doesn’t it?

Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it. Maybe the diversity and inclusion stuff doesn’t totally make sense to Bettman in 2025 – other North American sports have decided that they don’t have the stomach to fight the culture wars under Trump either, and NFL commission Roger Goodell is also on the White House sports council. On Monday, Browne told the Guardian via email that “to see [Bettman, Gretzky, and Tkachuk] get behind an administration that is targeting marginalized communities, especially trans people in sports, is deeply disturbing and a huge step backwards in making hockey a more inclusive sport.” “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued. What’s so aggravating about repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from the NHL under the guise of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these views are all morally equivalent when they’re not.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 3,\n  \"domain\": \"Sport\",\n  \"title\": \"The NHL preached inclusion.

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Freedom and joy: Rugby World Cup’s quirky quality sets it apart from the pack\nDOMAIN: Sport\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nI have a friend who rejects the notion of “guilty pleasures”. There is, she argues, plenty of real and justified guilt in the world, without co-opting it to our choice of trash TV or an unkickable penchant for romantasy novels. She’s a helpful touchstone when I hear myself trying to justify the silly superhero film I went to see at the cinema on the basis that it might have carried an underlying anti-fascist message (if you squinted hard enough at the screen). My friend will sigh kindly and then remind me: sometimes it’s OK just to enjoy things. It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer. Ask a football fan if they enjoyed themselves at the match they just paid a decent whack to see, and there’s a better-than-even chance they will tell you no. If it was a close match, they will have been too anxious to have fun; if they lost they will be mourning their defeat. Even if their own side ran rampant, you can find them complaining about the lack of challenge or jeopardy. We are, as fans, especially averse to one-sided games, which can feel anything from a deflationary disappointment to a waste of everybody’s time. This is why the current Women’s Rugby World Cup is such a curious phenomenon. The tournament has been one of largely lopsided scorelines, from the group stages to the quarter-finals. Only five of the 28 fixtures have been decided by fewer than 14 points, and more than half were won by more than 40 – at least six scores. And yet there remains a profound and unanimous pleasure to be had across the entire affair: it’s hard to find anyone that’s watching along and not enjoying it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). Meanwhile the action on the pitch has delivered flair and fascination, even on days when the rain has lashed down until the ball is butter and the scrums steam like suet pudding. The match-ups may be uneven but the power and athleticism on display on all sides of the pitch have been mesmerising. Sure, the host nation’s dominance is a natural mood enhancer. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. That’s only part of the picture, however. It doesn’t encompass the joyful embrace of The Kid, New Zealand’s 18-year-old top try-scorer Braxton Sorensen-McGee (whose daring dashes down the wing could well knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles if the two sides meet). It can’t account for the bipartisan cheer when Spain, 54-3 d\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nTheir fast-growing fanbase, many of whom have only discovered the sport in the past couple of years, do not show up to games with the typical baggage: decades of disappointment, crusted-over anger, inherited and inexplicably toxic rivalries. England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best. Other sports – and more pertinently their investors – will be analysing this fan engagement and wondering how to replicate it. Since the opening game between England and USA a festival atmosphere – prevalent at every ground from Sunderland to Bristol to Brighton – has been successfully transmitted through our television screens thanks to some excellent broadcasting decisions from the BBC (signing Ruby Tui was a stroke of genius). It is, perhaps, a lesson we particularly struggle with in sport because of its very nature. It is, of course, a marketing tactic as much as a rallying cry, but it came directly from team conversations and reflects something quite true about the women’s rugby community, that is a place where people are for each other, not against them. A huge part of our investment is grounded in the result and its consequences for whichever athlete or team we prefer.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 17,\n  \"domain\": \"Sport\",\n  \"title\": \"Freedom and joy: Rugby World Cup’s quirky quality sets it apart from the pack\",\n  \"tables\": [\n    {\n      \"header\": [\n        \"Cue Type\",\n        \"Subtype\",\n        \"Text Span\",\n        \"Preserved in Summary?\"\n      ],\n      \"rows\": [\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“guilty pleasures”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“kickable penchant”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“if you squinted hard enough”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“just to enjoy things”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes (“just enjoy…”)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“paid a decent whack”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“ran rampant”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“waste of everybody’s time”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“knock England’s cowgirls out of their saddles”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“come-as-you-are quality”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“forcing or faking it”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“for one brass farthing”\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Idiom / fixed expression\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"“for the girls” (slogan)\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Ruby Tui\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Braxton Sorensen-McGee\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Maro Itoje\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Ilona Maher\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Aseza Hele\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Abby Dow\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Anne-Marie\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"No\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Cue Type\": \"Cultural\",\n          \"Subtype\": \"Named people\",\n          \"Text Span\": \"Ellie Kildunne\",\n          \"Preserved in Summary?\": \"Yes (appears indirectly in summary?

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American\nDOMAIN: Sport\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nWhen the dust finally settles in the days after Sunday’s eagerly awaited US Open men’s final, the United States Tennis Association will issue its annual victory-lap press release. It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity and turning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination. But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician – any politician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval. According to internal emails obtained by outlets including PA and Bounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.) This is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protester gluing himself to a seat for nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind its US Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation. And to what end? Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy. Crowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa May was booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macron was whistled during the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is all but guaranteed a chorus of boos during public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next to the venom res\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nIt platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. But for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion. Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as
