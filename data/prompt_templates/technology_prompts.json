The playlists, which feature songs such as Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know and Apologize by OneRepublic, would make good soundtracks to romantic splits, but that’s not what they were. The playlists came together after Killawi was told by three different banks and payment processors they would no longer work with LaunchGood, the crowdfunding platform for the Muslim community she co-founded. Stripe said its banking partner instructed the company to cut ties with LaunchGood after five years of working with the crowdfunding platform. Stripe also told the company it couldn’t be associated with any international humanitarian work in sanctioned jurisdictions like Syria – a prerequisite for a crowdfunding platform that caters to the Muslim community. Another bank told the company there were too many Muslim and Arabic names and figuring out if those names belonged to sanctioned individuals was difficult. “People don’t realize Muhammad is the most sanctioned name,” Killawi, who was the chief operating officer at LaunchGood, said. With each dismissal, it felt like LaunchGood was on the brink of collapse. “If you can’t accept payments, you can’t exist as a company,” she said. There were few existing options that gave Killawi and her co-founders the stability and reliability they sought. So they did what a growing number of Muslim founders have done since: create their own solution. To mitigate the impact on the business if and when another bank decided to stop working with LaunchGood, Killawi and her co-founders Chris Blauvelt and Omar Hamid made the decision to establish a network of payment providers and banks to work with. Their hope was that there would no longer be one point of failure that could tank their business. When they were dumped by a bank, which continued to happen over the years, they had several backups. Now, more than 10 years since its founding, LaunchGood has become a household name and has enabled its largely Muslim user base to raise nearly $700m. While the platform also hosts personal fundraisers, LaunchGood is better known for its emphasis on charitable giving and has enabled its users to set up an automated donation for every day of the holy month of Ramadan. It has become the primary gateway for many during Ramadan, during which many Muslims donate to charities on a daily basis. The site’s rise and the challenges it has faced are not an anomaly. The “halal” consumer market, which includes halal food, financial services and other goods and services that cater to Muslims, has grown to an estimated $2tn globally, according to research and advisory firm Dinar Standard. Yet a 2022 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims were more likely than other faith groups to have their accounts at banks and other US financial institutions closed, investigated or otherwise challenged, with businesses effectively d\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nAnd in the last year, as more in tech have become more active around the cause of Palestine, an infrastructure for pro-Palestinian companies has also materialized. Muslim and pro-Palestinian founders have begun to question the leadership at Stripe. Paul Biggar, who was kicked off the board of a company he founded after writing a pro-Palestinian blogpost, started an incubator called Tech for Palestine that aims to provide support for companies that are advocating in some way for Palestinian freedom. Yet a 2022 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that Muslims were more likely than other faith groups to have their accounts at banks and other US financial institutions closed, investigated or otherwise challenged, with businesses effectively denying themselves access to Muslim customers. She hopes to provide for Muslim businesses and charities what LaunchGood’s team had to hack together for themselves: a reliable payment system that doesn’t discriminate. So they did what a growing number of Muslim founders have done since: create their own solution. Despite the challenges Muslim-run and pro-Palestinian companies face, Killawi remains bullish about businesses that cater to the Muslim community.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Meta scrapped factcheckers ‘because systems were too complex’\nDOMAIN: Technology\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nThe co-chair of Meta’s oversight board said the company’s systems had become “too complex”, as the chief executive of Elon Musk’s X welcomed its decision to scrap factcheckers. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the co-chair of the social media company’s oversight board and the former prime minister of Denmark, has said she and the departed president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, had agreed “Meta systems have been too complex”, adding that there had been “over-enforcement”. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg made the surprise announcement that the Facebook owner would move away from using third-party checkers to flag misleading content in favour of notes from other users. The 40-year-old billionaire said that, starting in the US, Meta would “get rid of factcheckers and replace them with community notes similar to X”, as the company moves to prioritise free speech in the run-up to Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The move came only days after Clegg, Britain’s former deputy prime minister, left Meta after six years at the company, most recently in the role of president of global affairs. In a departure post on Facebook, Clegg said he was proud of having worked on “new forms of governance”. During his time at Meta, he helped to establish the Facebook oversight board, an independent board that makes decisions on the social network’s moderation policies. Thorning-Schmidt told the BBC: “There are huge problems in what Mark Zuckerberg has announced yesterday and that’s why the existence of an oversight board is so important. We welcome looking into factchecking. We welcome that message, looking into the complexity and perhaps over-enforcement. “We’re very concerned about gender rights, LGBTQ+ rights, trans people’s rights on the platforms because we are seeing many instances where hate speech can lead to real-life harm, so we will be watching that space very carefully.” Clegg will be replaced by Joel Kaplan, who previously served as the deputy chief of staff for policy under the former president George W Bush, months after Trump’s election victory. Thorning-Schmidt said Clegg had “talked about leaving for a long time”. Her comments came as Linda Yaccarino, the head of X, welcomed Meta’s decision, saying “welcome to the party” during an appearance at the CES technology show in Las Vegas, hours after Zuckerberg announced the policy shift. The change will mean the social network moves away from third-party checkers to flag misleading content in favour of user-based notes. These have been introduced widely in recent years on X, formerly known as Twitter, particularly after Musk cut content moderators amid mass sackings after he bought the company in 2022. The decision by Meta, which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has been widely criticised by online safety campaigners and commentators, who said it would enable the flow of misinformation and harmful content.

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: ‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AI\nDOMAIN: Technology\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\n‘They called it an experiment aimed at younger audiences’ Mateusz Demski, 31, journalist, Kraków, Poland I’ve been a freelance journalist for 10 years, usually writing for magazines and websites about cinema. I presented a morning show on Radio Kraków twice a week for about two years. It was only one part of my work, but I really enjoyed it. It was about culture and cinema, and featured a range of people, from artists to activists. I remember interviewing Ukrainians about the Russian invasion for the first programme I presented, back in 2022. I was let go in August 2024, alongside a dozen co-workers who were also part-time. We were told the radio station was having financial problems. I was relatively OK with it, as I had other income streams. But a few months later I heard that Radio Kraków was launching programmes hosted by three AI characters. Each had AI-generated photographs, a biography and a specific personality. They called it an “experiment” aimed at younger audiences. One of the first shows they did was a live “interview” with Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, winner of the 1996 Nobel prize for literature, who had died 12 years earlier. What are the ethics of using the likeness of a dead person? Szymborska is a symbol of Polish intellectual culture, so it caused outrage. I couldn’t understand it: radio is created by people for other people. We cannot replace our experiences, emotions or voices with avatars. One of my colleagues who was laid off is queer. One of the new AI avatars was called Alex, a non-binary student and a “specialist” in queer subjects. In Poland, we are still fighting for queer rights, and as journalists it’s incumbent on us to have real representation when reporting on this. For my colleague and the LGBTQ+ community, it was shocking and damaging to hear their lived experience and knowledge being imitated by AI. Some of us who had been laid off started a petition against the station, calling for regulation and to get the AI shows taken off air. We got tens of thousands of people to sign – actors, journalists, artists, but also listeners. Hundreds of young people didn’t want to listen to an AI show. The station has since scrapped the avatars, largely because of the success of our campaign. It’s now student-run. The station claim this is about offering mentorship, but it’s also a cheaper alternative to hiring qualified journalists. I guess it’s better than AI, though. There are still no clear regulations covering its use in Poland. I’m not campaigning for regulation because I lost my job to AI: I’m campaigning because I’m worried about the ethics of all of this; about misinformation and deceiving listeners.I’m a realist – I’m not completely against AI. I think it can be used responsibly to do the boring bits of our job. But we can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence. * * * ‘Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced’ Lina Mei\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nEven the Indonesian government is using AI art: they recently released a video promoting a scheme that provides free lunches for students. I first learned about generative AI a few years ago, watching a YouTuber introduce viewers to the software Midjourney, which generates images based on prompts. The effect of generative AI in my industry is something I’ve felt personally. One client told me straight out that they have started using generative AI for their voices because it’s faster. When generative AI came along, the company was very vocal about using it as a tool to help clients get creative. Even before AI tools arrived, it wasn’t easy. One of the main platforms freelance artists use to get work recently launched a campaign called “Nobody cares if you use AI”, encouraging clients and artists to embrace AI tools.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT
