Jane led the Centre for African Studies at Leeds from 2004 to 2014, overseeing the innovative theatre and global development MA. In 2006 she was made professor of African theatre, with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka attending her inaugural lecture. A pivotal point in Jane’s career came in the 1990s with her long-term projects with Eritrean artists and educators in the aftermath of the war of independence. Most recently, Jane had a longstanding collaboration with We Are Walukuba, a community group in Jinja, Uganda. Over a decade, Jane and collaborators challenged the dominant short-term and message-based conventions of theatre for development by co-creating new approaches to challenge existing social issues. These long-term dialogical forms of artistic engagement promoted grassroots knowledge and discussion between community members and wider stakeholders. Her experience led to the publication of her two-volume A History of East African Theatre (2020, 2021), followed by Community-Based Arts, Research and Activism in Uganda: We Are Walukuba (2025), and her forthcoming monograph Somali Musical Theatre (2026). Born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, she was the daughter of Mary (nee Luckett), a legal secretary, and Gerald Plastow, who worked in local government. After attending Tunbridge Wells Girls’ grammar school, Jane completed a BA in English at the University of Manchester in 1981. She then travelled to Africa for the first time, undertaking a teaching post in the Gambia. This job would mark the beginning of a 44-year collaborative relationship with African artists, activists and educators traversing many countries including Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Somaliland, Djibouti and Zimbabwe. After her time in the Gambia, Jane became a lecturer at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, for three years. She then completed an MPhil and a PhD at Manchester, before moving to the Ulster University at Coleraine in 1991 to lecture in theatre studies, and then to Leeds in 1994. Jane acted as PhD supervisor for many students, many of whom went on to hold senior positions at leading African universities. In her years after her cancer diagnosis, Jane became interested in growing authoritarianism in the UK when her son, Will, was arrested for pro-Palestinian activism. Her uncompleted final book, provisionally titled Keir Starmer’s Political Prisoners, consisted of interviews with British political prisoners, and highlighted the increasingly severe state crackdown on dissent in the UK. Jane was a collaborator who truly believed, inhabited and realised the political power of the arts. She had an unrelenting and unstoppable energy and an enormous sense of fun. She is survived by Will, her brother, John, and sisters Beverley and Caroline.\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nJane acted as PhD supervisor for many students, many of whom went on to hold senior positions at leading African universities.

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Sacking of Christian school worker over posts about LGBTQ+ lessons unlawful, court rules\nDOMAIN: Educational\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nA Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to youn\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nIn a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Soaring costs trigger calls to address transport for Send pupils in England\nDOMAIN: Educational\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nHome-to-school transport costs in England have risen to £2.3bn a year, as increasing numbers of children with special educational needs and disabilities travel farther afield to schools that can meet their requirements, according to a report. More than half a million children and young people up to the age of 25 now get council-funded transport from their home to school or college, triggering a £415m overspend by local authorities last year, the National Audit Office (NAO) found. Of the 470,000 children under 16 who benefit, about 40% (180,000) have special educational needs and disabilities (Send), but councils spend approximately five times more on transport for Send pupils than others (£8,116 v £1,526), as they often have to travel further in single-occupancy taxis, contributing to a 70% real-terms increase in spending overall in the past eight years. Home-to-school transport is one of the fastest growing areas of local authority spending, according to the NAO, at a time when councils are struggling with growing deficits due to the sharp rise in the number of children and young people being assessed as needing education, health and care plans. The BBC reported this week that Reform UK’s George Finch, who became leader of Warwickshire county council at age 18, wrote to the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, seeking permission to revise the rules around pupil eligibility for free transport to save money. Phillipson said the plans, which could see pupils as young as eight walking up to five miles to school, showed Reform posed a danger to children. The government announced last week it was delaying the publication of its long-awaited white paper detailing plans to overhaul Send provision until next year. In its report on Friday, the NAO urged ministers to address home-to-school transport as part of its Send reforms. Local authorities are required to provide free transport for school-age children who cannot walk to their nearest suitable school due to distance, special educational needs or disabilities, or safety concerns, with extra support for low-income families. Because of the growing bill, however, the NAO said many councils were reducing provision of additional discretionary transport. As well as the increase in Send pupils, expenditure has gone up because of increased transport costs and growing demand due to public transport cuts in rural areas. “Local authorities are making savings to meet their statutory duties, but they are looking to the Department for Education’s upcoming Send reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of home-to-school transport,” said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO. Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, expressed concern that the national conversation about children with Send has become focused on cost. “We have to put the needs of these youngsters first and ensure that the Send system and associated costs are sufficiently funded both now and in the future.”\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nHome-to-school transport costs in England have risen to £2.3bn a year, as increasing numbers of children with special educational needs and disabilities travel farther afield to schools that can meet their requirements, according to a report. As well as the increase in Send pupils, expenditure has gone up because of increased transport costs and growing demand due to public transport cuts in rural areas. “A key element of this should be enabling greater inclusion in mainstream schools so they can better cater for more Send pupils’ needs, allowing them to be taught locally and reducing the reliance on specialist placements whilst cutting transport costs for local authorities.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Work is already under way to make sure more children with Send can achieve and thrive at their local school alongside their peers – including investing £740m to create more specialist school places and increasing access to early support for speech and language needs. Home-to-school transport is one of the fastest growing areas of local authority spending, according to the NAO, at a time when councils are struggling with growing deficits due to the sharp rise in the number of children and young people being assessed as needing education, health and care plans.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\":

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Trump and Project 2025 are attacking the Department of Education. How might they reshape US schools?\nDOMAIN: Educational\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nDonald Trump wants to shut down the US Department of Education, saying at recent rallies that it should be disbanded to “move everything back to the states where it belongs”. The idea of dismantling the education department has become increasingly mainstream, though it’s nearly as old as the department itself, which was created by Congress as a cabinet-level agency in 1979. Trump made similar promises on the 2016 campaign trail to either cut or hobble the department. Eliminating it would require Congress to act, which could be an impossible feat, though several of Trump and his allies’ policy goals on education could be accomplished through presidential actions. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing manifesto for a potential incoming Trump administration, lays out how dismantling the federal education department would work, leaving behind, if anything, a husk focused solely as a “statistics-gathering agency that disseminates information to the states”, writes Lindsey Burke, the author of the education chapter and leader of Heritage’s education policy center. The department’s elimination is one of many goals contained in the extensive conservative playbook that will inform a second Trump term. Project 2025 calls for privatizing education and driving out any programs related to LGBTQ+ youth or diversity. “This playbook actually goes into detail that we’ve never seen before,” said Weadé James, senior director for K-12 policy at the Center for American Progress. It would have profound implications on civil rights, school funding and students’ progress – not to mention on the fate of public schools, she said. “The striking part about all of this, too, is the Department of Education is actually the smallest of any cabinet-level agency. There are only a little over 4,000 employees within the department,” James said. “So we need to be talking about investing in the department, expanding the capacity of the department to do the work that it is designed to do.” Burke, the Heritage author , declined a request for an interview. In a statement, the Heritage Foundation said that while it seeks to offer recommendations to the “next conservative president”, it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign”. And while Trump’s campaign has tried to distance the candidate from Project 2025, saying he has his own agenda to carry out, the former president and the project are aligned on much of their education plans. During a speech to a “faith and freedom” conference this week, Trump railed against education rankings and spending, saying the US performs poorly despite money spent on students. Some states could do better without federal intervention, he said. “We’ll cut our budget in half and not everybody’s going to be great,” he said. “I mean, [California governor] Gavin Newsom will not do a good job with education, so I don’t expect that out of him. And I don’t expect it out of certain other people … But many of the states, I would say 40 of the 50 stat\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nTrump tells voters on his campaign site a few ways he would manage education: Cut federal funding for schools that are “pushing critical race theory or gender ideology on our children” and open civil rights investigations into them for race-based discrimination. School funding fundamentally changed Education is primarily funded and overseen by state and local authorities in the US, but the federal government funds some elements of education and sets certain policies, which are then implemented locally. Beyond these major funding changes, the project – and Trump – both want to see expansions of school choice, like voucher programs that allow students to use money that would otherwise fund their seats at public schools to attend a private ones. The project proposes ridding education programs of any “gender ideology and critical race theory”, like a “non-binary” category in data collection or the ability of trans youth to participate in sports aligned with their gender. Instead of directing how funds should be used, it generally says states should be given money with no strings attached to spend on “any lawful education purpose under state law”. The project also wants what remains of the Department of Education to gather data and report on programs or grants that spread “DEI/CRT/gender ideology”, how “family structure” affects student achievement, how pandemic aid funds were spent and how much money goes directly into the classroom from federal grant programs. Eliminating it would require Congress to act, which could be an impossible feat, though several of Trump and his allies’ policy goals on education could be accomplished through presidential actions.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT (showing how cues are identified and preservation determined):\n{\n  \"doc_id\": 0,\n  \"domain\": \"Educational\",\n  \"title\": \"Trump and Project 2025 are attacking the Department of Education.

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: UK students urged to mind terror laws before 7 October pro-Palestine protests\nDOMAIN: Educational\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nUniversity leaders have cautioned students planning to take part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations to coincide with the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, warning them that “expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence”. Up to 10 events – variously described as vigils, rallies and debates – are thought to have been planned on or near campuses on Tuesday, including an “inter-university” march in London, involving students and staff from several London institutions. It will be the second anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel, which left 1,200 people dead, many more injured or kidnapped and sparked the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 65,000 people. Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-chancellors and acts as the voice of the sector, wrote to members last week after the attack on Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, warning that the anniversary was a “potential flashpoint” and urging members to “review security arrangements”. Vivienne Stern, the UUK’s chief executive, said: “While universities must be places where contentious views can be expressed, and while universities have a legal duty to uphold free speech, we urge students and staff participating in protests to remember that 7 October is the anniversary of an atrocious attack on innocent people, and that expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence.” Details of the London march are posted on Instagram under the banner headline: “Inter-university march. Two years of genocide and our institutions remain complicit.” It calls for a walkout of classes at 2pm, with the route taking in King’s College London (KCL), the London School of Economics, University College London and finishing at SOAS. Other 7 October events have been advertised at the University of Sheffield, where the Revolutionary Communist party is staging a “rally for Palestine”, and Strathclyde University, where the Palestine Solidarity Society is staging a “Protest 4 Palestine”, while KCL Students for Justice for Palestine has an evening of debate and discussion called “Why it didn’t start on October 7th”. Stern said there has been a “deeply concerning” rise in antisemitic incidents in the last two years and the “UUK has worked closely with university leaders to tackle this”. She urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents. “We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,” she added. Louis Danker, the president of the Union of Jewish Students, said: “We respect the right to protest and the importance of free speech within the law. There are 365 days in the year and on one of them – 7 October – Jewish students seek the space to mourn their loved ones murdered in southern Israel. “Moreover, marking ‘two years of resistance’ on 7 Oct\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nShe urged university leaders to maintain close contact with Jewish student groups and to publicise mechanisms for reporting antisemitic incidents. “We have signposted resources to help universities combat antisemitism both from Universities UK and from the Community Security Trust and the Union of Jewish Students,” she added. Vivienne Stern, the UUK’s chief executive, said: “While universities must be places where contentious views can be expressed, and while universities have a legal duty to uphold free speech, we urge students and staff participating in protests to remember that 7 October is the anniversary of an atrocious attack on innocent people, and that expressing support for a terrorist organisation is a criminal offence.” There are 365 days in the year and on one of them – 7 October – Jewish students seek the space to mourn their loved ones murdered in southern Israel. Writing in the Times, the prime minister said: “Let me just spell that out for a moment: people on our streets calling for the murder of Jewish people they have never even met, for something they are not responsible for. And that’s before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.” The demonstration went ahead despite Starmer calling on protesters to call it off to “respect the grief of British Jews”, while Jewish leaders described the action as “phenomenally tone deaf” after Thursday’s killing of two people in the terror attack on a Manchester synagogue.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: Sacking of Christian school worker over posts about LGBTQ+ lessons unlawful, court rules\nDOMAIN: Educational\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nA Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Kristie Higgs was dismissed from her role as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager at Farmor’s, a secondary school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, in 2019 after an anonymous complaint from a parent at the school. On Wednesday, three court of appeal judges ruled in her favour, describing the decision to sack her for gross misconduct as “unlawfully discriminatory” and “disproportionate”. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. Higgs was dismissed after reposting and commenting on messages on her personal Facebook account that criticised plans to teach the No Outsiders equalities programme at her son’s Church of England primary school. The posts referred to “brainwashing” children and criticised the teaching of “gender fluidity” and the view that same-sex marriage was equivalent to marriage between a man and a woman, which conflicted with Higgs’s Christian faith. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”. An employment tribunal found in 2020 that while Higgs’s religion was a protected characteristic, her dismissal was still lawful, but this decision was subsequently overturned by an employment appeal tribunal (EAT) in 2023. The EAT then ruled the case should be sent back to an employment tribunal for a fresh decision, which Higgs’s lawyers challenged in the court of appeal as “unnecessary”. The court of appeal judgment ruled the decision to remit the case to the tribunal was discriminatory. Underhill said it was not in dispute that Higgs’s beliefs that gender was binary and same-sex marriage could not be equated with marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act 2010. The school, however, sought to justify her dismissal on the basis that the posts in question were “intemperately expressed and included insulting references to the promoters of gender fluidity and ‘the LGBT crowd’, which were liable to damage the school’s reputation in the community”. Underhill said in the judgment: “However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the claimant’s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils.” In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to youn\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nIn a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Higgs said: “In October 2018, I shared two private Facebook posts to raise awareness of the gender ideology that was going to be taught to young children in schools as part of statutory relationships and sex education. A Christian school worker who was sacked after she shared Facebook posts raising concerns about lessons in LGBTQ+ relationships for primary schoolchildren has won her battle in the court of appeal. Higgs welcomed the ruling as “a landmark day for Christian freedoms and free speech”. This judgment does not weaken the responsibility of schools and institutions to uphold inclusive policies, or to tackle discriminatory environments for both students and staff.” Expressing biblical Christian teaching on gender and sexuality may appear to be offensive to those who hold the opposite views, but as today’s judgment signals, Christians have a right to express their beliefs publicly. Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, ruled that the dismissal of an employee “merely because they have expressed a religious or other protected belief to which the employer, or a third party with whom it wishes to protect its reputation, objects will constitute unlawful direct discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act”.\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT

    "formatted_text": "ARTICLE TITLE: UK university cuts threaten to ‘wipe out’ black scholarship, academics say\nDOMAIN: Educational\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE (identify cues from here):\nBlack scholarship in the UK risks being wiped out due to redundancies and course closures, leading academics have warned. Universities in England are engulfed in a financial crisis and have in response implemented a number of cost-cutting measures. But prominent academics and students are raising the alarm that these cuts are falling on lecturers and courses that played a leading role in addressing racial disparities in higher education. The University of Chichester made Prof Hakim Adi redundant and cut his MRes on the history of Africa and the African diaspora. Prof Robert Beckford, the well-known theologian who researched climate and social justice, has been made redundant at the University of Winchester, and Birmingham City University (BCU) shuttered its black studies undergraduate course. While Goldsmiths, University of London reversed plans to cut its Black British literature MA, stating it would commit to running the course for another two years after an outcry, it recently made the founder and convener of the course, Prof Deirdre Obsorne, redundant. Kadija George Sesay, who was one of several writers to sign an open letter criticising the move, told the Guardian that she had returned her honorary fellowship to Goldsmiths. In the past decade, there were notable advances in the creation of dedicated lectureships, and broader curriculum development in black history, culture, politics and philosophy in higher education. This, as well as active mentoring and recruitment of academics of colour, led to improvements in the number of black professors in the UK. But universities say they are in the midst of a dire financial crisis and these courses, while expensive to run, are not as popular as they are in the US, where the discipline of black history and arts is more established. Campaigners say the courses and the lecturers’ specialist knowledge should be ringfenced and require time and development to have an impact. Even with recent improvements, fewer than 1% of professors are black. Beckford said: “The reality is I’ve never been in a job since 1993 which has been secure. I’ve always had the threat of redundancy because there was always a lack of funding for posts that were connected to race. I’ve never had that kind of luxury of knowing that I was in a place that was going to invest in me and give me lots of time to develop my craft.” Beckford, who alone supported 16 black PhD students, added: “You get a freeze on the development and mentoring by jettisoning people like me. My work has always been fundamentally about empowering black students, empowering black colleagues.” While the University of Winchester said it would not comment on individual cases, a spokesperson noted that “all the redundancies upon which we have consulted reflect the challenging financial circumstances facing the university sector”. Prof Kehinde Andrews, who leads Birmingham City University’s black studies department, said he was disappointed but not surprised when he wa\n[...article truncated for brevity...]\n\nSUMMARY (check if cues are preserved here):\nMy work has always been fundamentally about empowering black students, empowering black colleagues.” Black scholarship in the UK risks being wiped out due to redundancies and course closures, leading academics have warned. “What kind of message does removing opportunities for access to that knowledge send to students and future generations of black creatives?” But prominent academics and students are raising the alarm that these cuts are falling on lecturers and courses that played a leading role in addressing racial disparities in higher education. A spokesperson for the University of Chichester said while it had made the “difficult decision” to suspend a number of courses, current masters students “were encouraged to complete their studies with us and were offered appropriate tuition”. Adi believes these cuts will have a dire impact on the number of black history professors in the UK. In the past decade, there were notable advances in the creation of dedicated lectureships, and broader curriculum development in black history, culture, politics and philosophy in higher
