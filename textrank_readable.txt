- Ken Skates, who took over as transport cabinet secretary in March 2024, was quickly forced into a partial climbdown, giving councils £5m to reassess local speed limits over what he described as “consistent” concerns.
- The change from 30mph was brought in by the Welsh Labour government across about 35% of the country’s roads in September 2023, at a cost of £34m. The reduced speed limit applied to any built-up area, defined as roads where lamp-posts were no more than about 180 metres apart.
- The backlash included protests, defacing and knocking down new speed limit signs, and a petition signed by nearly half a million people opposing the policy – the largest in the Senedd’s history.
- Last week a small study by GoSafe, which monitors road cameras, found the policy had added an average of two minutes to journey times of differing lengths, aggravating an already bitter culture war over legislation designed to save lives.

The comedian has been under fire, alongside Kevin Hart, Louis CK, Aziz Ansari and Dave Chappelle, for being on the lineup for what was billed as “the world’s largest comedy festival”.

“The seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder is no laughing matter, and comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn’t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher. Since appearing, the lesbian comic Jessica Kirson has expressed “sincere regret” but said she was there to “help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued”.

- White House occupants do have a history of tweaking, expanding and remodelling.
- His more recent engoldening of the Oval Office, described by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt as a “golden office for the golden age”, has been unflatteringly compared to a professional wrestler’s dressing room.
- “It gives Trump a narrative of authority and tradition,” says Daniel Abramson, professor of architectural history at Boston University, “and fits into his overarching strategy of undermining the established elites, including in architecture.”
- On re-assuming the presidency, one of his first executive orders – under the title Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again – mandated that “traditional and classical architecture” should be the preferred style for all federal public buildings, with Trump having the final veto on designs.

- Her eight “pop-up” shows this fall, billed as the Visions of Damsels &amp; Other Dangerous Things tour, span the geographical linchpins of her music: four shows in New York, site of sexual awakenings (Naked in Manhattan) and devastating breakups (new single The Subway, the night’s pre-eminent vehicle for Roan’s torrential belt); two in Kansas City, Missouri, a few hours from her hometown of Willard; and two in Los Angeles, where Roan forged the joyously queer and infectiously cheeky pop of her debut and still only studio album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.
- Roan was allegedly not “feeling 100” on Sunday night – “I have a migraine, so I can’t bang my head super hard, but that’s kinda my thing, so pretend I bang my head a lot tonight,” she said before nominally teaching the YMCA-style Hot To Go!
- Her rise was so vertiginous – viral Tiny Desk, Grammys best new artist, festival undercard to headliner, international chart takeover – that she feels lifetimes away from the artist I saw, stunned by her own zeitgeist earthquake at New York’s Governors Ball in June of last year.
- It’s a testament to the potency of Roan’s maximalist sound, chock-full of sexually frank lyrics, baroque feelings and lavish camp, that a 93-minute set containing almost every song she’s recorded had the feeling of a greatest hits show.

- Limited to only 500 copies, Punjabi Disco disappeared from circulation almost as quickly as it was released, leaving Mohinder to go back to singing at Sikh weddings and Kuljit to producing bhangra records by groups such as Heera.
- ‘Punjabi Disco is the holy grail of British Asian music,” DJ and label boss Raghav Mani says.
- He said it was called Punjabi Disco and he had just bought the last copy in existence, directly from Kuljit.”
- Yet, months after being told by executives at EMI India that the record would be released, the family stumbled upon a cassette with the title Punjabi Disco being sold in a Southall record shop, featuring a different singer and new songs.
- By the new decade, Mohinder and the Bhamra family band had become notorious for enabling the first mixed British Asian dancefloors and the songs in their repertoire began to change to suit their crowd.
- She was the first woman in her community to sing at local Sikh gurdwara events and progressed to performing at wedding receptions.
- Mani and his business partner Filip Nikolic immediately decided to see if Kuljit was willing to release a reissue on their archival label Naya Beat.

Limited to only 500 copies, Punjabi Disco disappeared from circulation almost as quickly as it was released, leaving Mohinder to go back to singing at Sikh weddings and Kuljit to producing bhangra records by groups such as Heera. ‘Punjabi Disco is the holy grail of British Asian music,” DJ and label boss Raghav Mani says. He said it was called Punjabi Disco and he had just bought the last copy in existence, directly from Kuljit.” Yet, months after being told by executives at EMI India that the record would be released, the family stumbled upon a cassette with the title Punjabi Disco being sold in a Southall record shop, featuring a different singer and new songs. By the new decade, Mohinder and the Bhamra family band had become notorious for enabling the first mixed British Asian dancefloors and the songs in their repertoire began to change to suit their crowd. She was the first woman in her community to sing at local Sikh gurdwara events and progressed to performing at wedding receptions. Mani and his business partner Filip Nikolic immediately decided to see if Kuljit was willing to release a reissue on their archival label Naya Beat.

- Afounder member of the British folk-rock band Pentangle, the double bass player Danny Thompson also added depth and resonance to recordings by artists as varied as Nick Drake and Kate Bush, Cliff Richard and Everything But the Girl, Graham Coxon and John Martyn – to name a handful among the hundreds of sessions he played on from the early 1960s into the 21st century.
- It was not the first theme tune for Thompson, who, having realised that recording sessions were more financially rewarding than playing live – “all the money I used to earn on jazz gigs used to get blown before I got home” – had in 1964 played on the recording for the theme music of the TV series Thunderbirds.
- His fluid playing enriched the albums Five Leaves Left (1969) by Drake and Solid Air (1973) by Martyn, and he went on to form a long working relationship with Martyn, and, later, the singer-songwriter Richard Thompson (no relation).
- After Pentangle split in 1972, Thompson chose not to join another group, but to concentrate on playing sessions – the record producer Joe Boyd having already paired him with Drake for Five Leaves Left, did the same with Martyn and Solid Air.
- Thompson and Martyn were kindred spirits, heavy drinkers who delighted in displays of disruptive, drunken behaviour while touring.
- However, in the late 70s, Thompson sobered up, and the reverence his recordings with Drake and Martyn were now held in eventually found him again in demand as a session player: in the mid-80s David Sylvian, Bush, Talk Talk, The The, Everything But the Girl, Coxon and Skin all employed him for his lyrical playing.
- Thompson’s first marriage ended in divorce in the late 70s.

- Touring in Europe in 1972, DeJohnette met Manfred Eicher, the founder of ECM Records, and an innovator who had long foreseen how global musical developments in jazz were moving.
- In 2024, a previously unreleased 1966 recording – Forces of Nature: Live at Slugs’ – emerged as a captivating indication of what DeJohnette’s impact on the jazz scene of his early years must have sounded like, in an enthralling encounter at the famous New York club, with Henderson on saxophone, Tyner on piano, and Henry Grimes on bass.
- But in between had come a 1968 European tour with Evans’s trio, which included a Montreux jazz festival performance that won a Grammy in its recorded version – notably aided by the young DeJohnette’s willingness to push even the most revered of jazz elders beyond their comfort zones.
- The experience of DeJohnette live onstage was always enthralling, but his charisma was never a distraction from whatever music he was there to bring to life.
- One of the most creative and viscerally thrilling exponents of that pivotal jazz art was Jack DeJohnette, the percussionist, pianist, composer and bandleader, who has died aged 83.
- Between 1979 and 1984, DeJohnette recorded a bold and personal sequence of ECM albums, Special Edition, Tin Can Alley and Album Album, featuring such powerful saxophonists as David Murray, Arthur Blythe and Chico Freeman, and revealing his own powers as a composer.

- Inevitably, Shankly pops up in Home Ground, a punchy new exhibition on the architecture and social culture of football stadiums.
- “Spaceship” is an overused epithet, but football stadiums do have an otherworldly aura, as modern colossi looming above huddled neighbourhoods, evocative of Philip Larkin’s “ships up streets”.
- Unimaginably removed from the era of seething crowds on acres of terraces, the future of football stadiums lies in being increasingly sustainable and flexible.

- Ellie Costello of Not Fine in School, which supports children and families struggling with school attendance, wants the government to ensure mandatory reporting of the use of isolation in mainstream schools, as is already the case with suspensions and exclusions.

- The lead professor of #BeeWell, Neil Humphrey, said: “We know schools face huge pressures in managing behaviour, but our evidence suggests isolation is not the solution.
- The use of isolation, and in particular isolation booths, has become a growing source of concern among some parents, who complain about an overly punitive system that harms their child’s education and mental health.
- A DfE spokesperson said there should be high expectations around pupil behaviour and schools should expect parents to back them.
- Pupils on free school meals were more than one-and-a-half times more likely to be placed in isolation than their wealthier peers, researchers found from self-reported data provided by pupils.

The lead professor of #BeeWell, Neil Humphrey, said: “We know schools face huge pressures in managing behaviour, but our evidence suggests isolation is not the solution. The use of isolation, and in particular isolation booths, has become a growing source of concern among some parents, who complain about an overly punitive system that harms their child’s education and mental health. A DfE spokesperson said there should be high expectations around pupil behaviour and schools should expect parents to back them. Pupils on free school meals were more than one-and-a-half times more likely to be placed in isolation than their wealthier peers, researchers found from self-reported data provided by pupils.

Isolation usually involves removing a pupil from a class for disruptive behaviour and asking them to work alone or in silence in a separate room, but parents complain that children can be put into isolation for minor breaches of school rules, which those with complex behaviours and special needs may find difficult to adhere to. Ellie Costello of Not Fine in School, which supports children and families struggling with school attendance, wants the government to ensure mandatory reporting of the use of isolation in mainstream schools, as is already the case with suspensions and exclusions.

- Home-to-school transport costs in England have risen to £2.3bn a year, as increasing numbers of children with special educational needs and disabilities travel farther afield to schools that can meet their requirements, according to a report.
- As well as the increase in Send pupils, expenditure has gone up because of increased transport costs and growing demand due to public transport cuts in rural areas.
- “A key element of this should be enabling greater inclusion in mainstream schools so they can better cater for more Send pupils’ needs, allowing them to be taught locally and reducing the reliance on specialist placements whilst cutting transport costs for local authorities.”
- A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Work is already under way to make sure more children with Send can achieve and thrive at their local school alongside their peers – including investing £740m to create more specialist school places and increasing access to early support for speech and language needs.
- Home-to-school transport is one of the fastest growing areas of local authority spending, according to the NAO, at a time when councils are struggling with growing deficits due to the sharp rise in the number of children and young people being assessed as needing education, health and care plans.

Home-to-school transport costs in England have risen to £2.3bn a year, as increasing numbers of children with special educational needs and disabilities travel farther afield to schools that can meet their requirements, according to a report. As well as the increase in Send pupils, expenditure has gone up because of increased transport costs and growing demand due to public transport cuts in rural areas. “A key element of this should be enabling greater inclusion in mainstream schools so they can better cater for more Send pupils’ needs, allowing them to be taught locally and reducing the reliance on specialist placements whilst cutting transport costs for local authorities.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Work is already under way to make sure more children with Send can achieve and thrive at their local school alongside their peers – including investing £740m to create more specialist school places and increasing access to early support for speech and language needs. Home-to-school transport is one of the fastest growing areas of local authority spending, according to the NAO, at a time when councils are struggling with growing deficits due to the sharp rise in the number of children and young people being assessed as needing education, health and care plans.

- They moved in 1967 to Lincoln for David to take up the post of principal careers officer there, and six years later the family settled in Shropshire.
- David was known for his wry sense of humour and being able to conceal his irritation when faced with a lack of understanding of career guidance.
- In his year as president, 1978-79, David’s capacity for networking and writing won influence with the then employment secretary Jim Prior as well as with decision-makers in local authority associations.
- In 1974 David set up the new local education authority careers service in Shropshire (following the passing of the Employment and Training Act 1973), at a time of global recession, rising youth unemployment and a need to improve qualifications to drive up quality.

- “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued.

- England’s vast buffer of experience and professionalism has allowed them to see off whatever challenges are temporarily posed: fans have been able to relax and enjoy the show even when their team is not at its brilliant best.
- Other sports – and more pertinently their investors – will be analysing this fan engagement and wondering how to replicate it.

- The pole was a real statement of intent from Norris and McLaren and exactly the riposte they required after the recent momentum Verstappen has gathered as he closed the gap to the leaders.

- Ali Alyami, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Saudi Arabia, said the Saudi ruling family’s extravagant investment in sports is designed to divert global attention from its religious extremism and gross violations of basic human rights.
- For the league, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic could mark the start of a new chapter – one where flag football becomes a global phenomenon and the NFL’s future is no longer confined to American shores and a handful of international games during the regular season.

- But for critics, it’s part of a much bigger debate about what role Saudi Arabia – and its billions – should play in the world of sports.
- The showcase event is expected to serve as a major lead-in to flag football’s debut at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, where the NFL hopes the sport’s inclusion will accelerate its growth worldwide.

- While Alcaraz was alert from the beginning, putting Djokovic under sustained pressure with the consistency and depth of his return of serve as he immediately broke, Djokovic was flat and erratic.
- Despite being at such contrasting points in their careers, Djokovic and Alcaraz have spent the past few years battling as equals, with the Serb compiling a favourable head-to-head record and pulling off some of his most memorable wins against the Spaniard.
- After Alcaraz closed out the second set, Djokovic immediately requested the trainer, who massaged the Serb’s neck during the change of ends.
- On another occasion during the earlier part of his career, Alcaraz may have offered Djokovic a lifeline with an erratic performance in the tie-break, but not this time.
- With Alcaraz’s superior weight of shot and athleticism, the gulf between them was stark in the moments when Alcaraz found his top level.
- There was once a time when Alcaraz himself would frequently speak of the “rollercoasters” he would find himself on in matches, his tendency to pair his spectacular shotmaking with bewildering performances and to leave himself in unnecessarily protracted battles.

Despite being at such contrasting points in their careers, Djokovic and Alcaraz have spent the past few years battling as equals, with the Serb compiling a favourable head-to-head record and pulling off some of his most memorable wins against the Spaniard. After Alcaraz closed out the second set, Djokovic immediately requested the trainer, who massaged the Serb’s neck during the change of ends. On another occasion during the earlier part of his career, Alcaraz may have offered Djokovic a lifeline with an erratic performance in the tie-break, but not this time. With Alcaraz’s superior weight of shot and athleticism, the gulf between them was stark in the moments when Alcaraz found his top level. There was once a time when Alcaraz himself would frequently speak of the “rollercoasters” he would find himself on in matches, his tendency to pair his spectacular shotmaking with bewildering performances and to leave himself in unnecessarily protracted battles.

As others have noted, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter who attacked a Minneapolis Catholic school.

The growth of social media and erosion of previous gatekeepers have also left it unclear how to counter the spread of online radicalization, especially given social media platforms’ shift towards shirking responsibility for hosting violent and extreme content. Although technological influences are only one part of rising political violence – along with mental health issues, political polarization and the widespread availability of firearms in the US – extremism researchers are increasingly studying the evolving ways that social media platforms and online spaces can radicalize and isolate users. In fact, some say that the current era of political violence differs from past incarnations specifically because of the way that social media and online communities have influenced and incentivized attackers.

- Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church.
- In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able to marry in church since 2017.
- “The church in Norway has caused LGBTQ+ people shame, great harm and pain,” the presiding bishop, Olav Fykse Tveit, said on Thursday.
- Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last year apologised for its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman.
- Against a backdrop of red stage curtains at one of Oslo’s most prominent LGBTQ+ spaces, the Church of Norway apologised for the discrimination and harm it had inflicted.
- Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people.

- In addition to describing the case as political persecution, his legal team has told local media that some of the offences listed in the US indictment are not crimes in Guyana and therefore Mohamed should not be subject to extradition.
- Azruddin Mohamed, 38, and his father, Nazar Mohamed, 73, two of Guyana’s wealthiest figures thanks to their gold mining empire, were arrested on 31 October in the capital, Georgetown, in response to a formal extradition request from the US government.
- Mohamed has claimed they are victims of political persecution by Ali’s government: “The government is fully behind the sanctions and has agents working in the US that they are in talks with,” he told local media.
- Although the US extradition request was issued last October, the investigation into Mohamed and his father began earlier, and the indictment is said to cover offences committed between 2017 and 2024.
- The case has become particularly emblematic at a time when relations between the Caribbean nation and the US have taken on new energy significance, with American companies leading the oil exploration that could soon make Guyana the world’s largest producer per capita.
- Guyana has been thrown into political turmoil following the arrest and possible extradition to the United States of the country’s main opposition leader just two months after he emerged as the surprise contender in the presidential election that kept incumbent Irfaan Ali in power.
- Mohabir Anil Nandlall, Guyana’s attorney general, said the case was a “legal obligation” arising from the country’s international commitments – a 1931 extradition treaty between the UK and the US remains in force in Guyana, which became independent from Britain in 1966.

- Just before Christmas 2020, in the dying days of his first administration, Trump had already taken time off from his busy schedule promoting the big lie about having won the election in order to issue an executive order entitled “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture”.
- True, in one sense Trump’s case is unique: he already had a portfolio of buildings before assuming office – though most of his own buildings had never been particularly classical; instead, they are modern on the outside, while on the inside one finds a nouveau riche fever fantasy of Versailles – which has now also spawned an engoldened Oval Office, displaying what an astute critic, Kate Wagner, has called “regional car dealership rococo”.
- For all these peculiarities, Trump’s disfiguring the White House fits into a larger global trend: far-right populist leaders in many countries have used spectacular architecture to advance their political agenda and, more particularly, to set their vision of a “real people” – as in “real Americans”, “real Hungarians” et cetera – in stone.
- Architects promoting traditional styles have been happy to go along with Trump’s ideas.

- An audience likes to feel it has done a bit of work before arriving at a punch line, which is why, on Monday, when demolition crews moved into the White House to knock down part of the East Wing at the behest of Donald Trump, it felt once again like we were living in post-satirical times.
- Joe Biden had less time to renovate, but did swap out Trump’s gold drapes in the Oval Office for some sober Clinton-era curtains and a new rug.
- As for what the new space might look like, we must assume that Clark Construction and McCrery Architects, the design and building entities involved, will be led by Trump’s general aesthetic and find a happy medium between the Grand Ballroom at Mar-a-Lago and Saddam Hussein’s palace.
- This was the first stage of a project Trump has advertised as the addition to the White House of a 90,000 sq ft (8,300 sq metres) ballroom, at an estimated cost of $250m (£187m) and a capacity, according to Trump, of “999 people”.
- Trump, meanwhile, paved over the Rose Garden, decked out the Oval Office in gold, and now appears to be wholesale demolishing the East Wing’s 1942 facade to build a giant event space – and you have to wonder if the state banquet he enjoyed at Windsor Castle last month has been a spur to get construction under way.
- As far as we can tell from the photos, Trump didn’t actually send in a wrecking ball – although his administration did sharply reprimand government employees working in a neighbouring Treasury building for posting visuals of the demolition online, so at this point who knows?

- Add to that the fact that just this month, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, vowed to take the UK out of net zero commitments that her party once heralded, and that Reform UK, which continues to lead in the polls, has aggressively attacked climate policies across the board and I wonder: doesn’t he feel frightened?
- According to a Guardian investigation, millions more homes across England, Scotland and Wales are at risk of devastating floods.
- In depth: ‘It is absolutely a sign that the climate crisis is here and escalating’ Every constituency in Great Britain is expected to face greater flood risk in the years ahead, according to a study by the insurer Aviva.
- “He says ‘we’re not in this because we’re climate campaigners or trying to burnish our credentials or because we have a political agenda.
- “We environment reporters often write about NGOs and campaigners and climate scientists calling for different things, which is great and important.
- But the government’s drive for growth and building 1.5m extra homes by the end of this parliament has raised fears that essential nature and climate considerations will be cast aside.
- On Tuesday, floods minister Emma Hardy announced a £10.5bn investment to protect 900,000 properties in England, alongside new measures designed to speed up the delivery of these defences – which is great, but what I want to know from Matthew is whether it’s all going to be enough.

Add to that the fact that just this month, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, vowed to take the UK out of net zero commitments that her party once heralded, and that Reform UK, which continues to lead in the polls, has aggressively attacked climate policies across the board and I wonder: doesn’t he feel frightened? According to a Guardian investigation, millions more homes across England, Scotland and Wales are at risk of devastating floods. In depth: ‘It is absolutely a sign that the climate crisis is here and escalating’ Every constituency in Great Britain is expected to face greater flood risk in the years ahead, according to a study by the insurer Aviva. “He says ‘we’re not in this because we’re climate campaigners or trying to burnish our credentials or because we have a political agenda. “We environment reporters often write about NGOs and campaigners and climate scientists calling for different things, which is great and important. But the government’s drive for growth and building 1.5m extra homes by the end of this parliament has raised fears that essential nature and climate considerations will be cast aside. On Tuesday, floods minister Emma Hardy announced a £10.5bn investment to protect 900,000 properties in England, alongside new measures designed to speed up the delivery of these defences – which is great, but what I want to know from Matthew is whether it’s all going to be enough.

- That’s the same Washington Post, of course, that refused to publish Pulitzer prize winner Ann Telnaes’s cartoon of billionaire Bezos kneeling before Trump.
- But what’s so terrifying about the current moment isn’t flattering interview edits, it’s the way that Trump and his friends are seeking to edit our relationship with reality.
- But the Trump-friendly editing of an interview conducted by a network now owned by the president’s allies, with a head of news that he thinks is “great”, is part of a broader trend of US media outlets lying down and rolling over for Trump.
- Take Elon Musk, who helped propel Trump to his second term.
- Look at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post, whose editorial board recently published a defence of Trump’s teardown of the White House’s east wing for his ballroom.
- Also not fully aired on the TV broadcast: a segment in which the president claimed he didn’t know a crypto tycoon who went to prison for breaching money laundering laws, despite the fact that Trump pardoned him.
- When our very handsome (much better-looking than Zohran Mamdani!) and very high-IQ leader Donald Trump gives me a personal shoutout to commend me on what a wonderful job I’m doing.

- As a 2016 presidential candidate, competing against Trump (who ridiculed him as “Little Marco”), he championed traditional US alliances, human rights and foreign aid.
- Rubio plays front man, too, for Trump’s crude pressure campaigns against Panama, Brazil and Mexico, mass deportations of migrants to prisons run by El Salvador’s repressive regime, and overall attempt to reduce Latin America once again to a semi-colonised US backyard.
- US overseas assistance budgets have been gutted, democracy promotion and human rights deprioritised, and direct US support for Ukraine eviscerated.
- While Trump runs the show and hogs the limelight on Israel, Ukraine and China, Rubio, 54, acts as prop, cheerleader and repairman.
- His tenure as secretary of state was initially overshadowed by Elon Musk, who slashed state department jobs and soft power programmes while Rubio looked away; and more recently by Steve Witkoff, the Trump crony dubbed “envoy for everything”.
- Vance habitually weaponises social media to defend Trump and vilify “crazy leftwing radicals”.

- Rio officials said on Tuesday that at least 64 people, including four police officers, had been killed after a force of 2,500 launched a pre-dawn assault on Alemão and Penha, the vast patchwork of favelas of which Vila Cruzeiro is part.
- Between 4.15am and 9am, when government body collectors finally arrived, the Guardian witnessed pickup trucks delivering dozens of corpses to a square in Vila Cruzeiro named after Saint Luke the Evangelist.
- Day had yet to break over Vila Cruzeiro but already dozens of corpses were splayed out along the favela’s main drag after more than 130 people were killed during the deadliest police operation in Rio’s history: grotesquely disfigured, blood-smeared bodies that had been dragged out of nearby forests and dumped on blue tarpaulins and black plastic sheets covering the street.
- As he waited for another car-load of bodies to arrive, Correia, the community leader, recalled how two decades earlier a group of local evangelical missionaries had warned that the favela would one day suffer a momentous bloodbath.
- Rio’s governor celebrated “a harsh blow” to the heavily-armed drug traffickers who have seized control of many of Rio’s hundreds of favelas over the past 40 years.
- But there was to be no resurrection for Santana’s son, nor for the dozens of other bodies lined up beside him outside a sushi restaurant with bullet wounds to their limbs, torsos and heads.
- I have no words,” said Raull Santiago, a favela activist, as another cargo of corpses arrived, sending local women scrambling in search of their missing husbands, brothers or sons.
